Add build check before e2e tests\n```yaml\n# In CI or test script\npnpm build \u0026\u0026 pnpm test:e2e\n```\n\n### 2. Don't silently skip feature-gated tests\n```typescript\n// Bad: silently skips\nif (!isVisible) { test.skip(true, 'Feature not enabled'); }\n\n// Better: fail if feature is expected\nawait expect(nlInput).toBeVisible({ timeout: 5000 });\n```\n\n### 3.
