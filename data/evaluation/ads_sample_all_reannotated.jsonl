Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10%-15% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant.

Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted \"base ΛCDM\" in this paper).

We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales.

The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations.

The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit Planck base ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations.

The Planck results for base ΛCDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae.

{"bibcode": "2011ApJS..192...18K", "title": "Seven-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Cosmological Interpretation", "abstract": "The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H <SUB>0</SUB>) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter ΛCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is n<SUB>s</SUB> = 0.968 ± 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, ∑m <SUB>ν</SUB> &lt; 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N <SUB>eff</SUB> = 4.34<SUP>+0.86</SUP> <SUB>-0.88</SUB> (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H <SUB>0</SUB>.

By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H 0) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter ΛCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 ± 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, ∑m ν < 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34+0.86 -0.88 (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H 0.

Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. <BR /> Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. <BR /> Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars.

Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. <BR /> Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.", "abstract_clean": "Context.

Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.", "database": ["astronomy"], "keywords": ["catalogs", "astrometry", "techniques: radial velocities", "stars: fundamental parameters", "stars: variables: general", "minor planets",

The bulk composition of an average CI carbonaceous chondrite is defined from previous compilations and from the refractory element compositions of different groups of chondrites.

The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available.

This benefited from many of the changes introduced into operational forecasting since the mid-1990s, when the systems used for the 15-year ECMWF re-analysis (ERA-15) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis were implemented. Several of the improvements are discussed. General aspects of the production of the analyses are also summarized. A number of results indicative of the overall performance of the data assimilation system, and implicitly of the observing system, are presented and discussed. The comparison of background (short-range) forecasts and analyses with observations, the consistency of the global mass budget, the magnitude of differences between analysis and background fields and the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from the ERA-40 analyses are illustrated. Several results demonstrate the marked improvement that was made to the observing system for the southern hemisphere in the 1970s, particularly towards the end of the decade. In contrast, the synoptic quality of the analysis for the northern hemisphere is sufficient to provide forecasts that remain skilful well into the medium range for all years.

The observing system changed considerably over this re-analysis period, with assimilable data provided by a succession of satellite-borne instruments from the 1970s onwards, supplemented by increasing numbers of observations from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other surface platforms, but with a declining number of radiosonde ascents since the late 1980s.

The extractant consists of 0.005M DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), 0.1M triethanolamine, and 0.01M CaCl<SUB>2</SUB>, with a pH of 7.3. The soil test consists of shaking 10 g of air-dry soil with 20 ml of extractant for 2 hours. The leachate is filtered, and Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu are measured in the filtrate by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The soil test successfully separated 77 Colorado soils on the basis of crop response to Zn, Fe, and Mn fertilizers. Critical nutrient levels must be determined separately for each crop using standardized procedures for soil preparation, grinding, and extraction. The critical levels for corn using the procedures reported herein were: 0.8 ppm for Zn, 4.5 ppm for Fe, and tentatively 1.0 ppm for Mn, and 0.2 ppm for Cu.

The extractant consists of 0.005M DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), 0.1M triethanolamine, and 0.01M CaCl2, with a pH of 7.3. The soil test consists of shaking 10 g of air-dry soil with 20 ml of extractant for 2 hours. The leachate is filtered, and Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu are measured in the filtrate by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The soil test successfully separated 77 Colorado soils on the basis of crop response to Zn, Fe, and Mn fertilizers. Critical nutrient levels must be determined separately for each crop using standardized procedures for soil preparation, grinding, and extraction. The critical levels for corn using the procedures reported herein were: 0.8 ppm for Zn, 4.5 ppm for Fe, and tentatively 1.0 ppm for Mn, and 0.2 ppm for Cu.

Station anomalies (from 1961 to 1990 means) were interpolated into 0.5° latitude/longitude grid cells covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), and combined with an existing climatology to obtain absolute monthly values. The dataset includes six mostly independent climate variables (mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, precipitation, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure and cloud cover). Maximum and minimum temperatures have been arithmetically derived from these. Secondary variables (frost day frequency and potential evapotranspiration) have been estimated from the six primary variables using well-known formulae. Time series for hemispheric averages and 20 large sub-continental scale regions were calculated (for mean, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation totals) and compared to a number of similar gridded products.

During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I<SUB>C</SUB>≈4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets.

Over this time interval, the most striking feature of the obliquity solution, apart from a secular global increase due to tidal dissipation, is a strong decrease of about 0.38 degree in the next few millions of years, due to the crossing of the s6+g5-g6 resonance (Laskar et al. \\cite{Laskar1993}). For the calibration of the Mesozoic time scale (about 65 to 250 Myr), we propose to use the term of largest amplitude in the eccentricity, related to g2-g5, with a fixed frequency of 3.200''/yr, corresponding to a period of 405 000 yr. The uncertainty of this time scale over 100 Myr should be about 0.1%, and 0.2% over the full Mesozoic era.", "database": ["astronomy"], "keywords": ["chaos", "celestial mechanics", "ephemerides", "Earth"], "year": "2004", "doctype": "article", "citation_count": 3204, "domain_category": "planetary_science", "spans": [{"surface": "insolation", "start": 71, "end": 81, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:propEnergyFlux/Insolation", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "Earth", "start": 96, "end": 101, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05byh2e17", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "with respect to", "start": 169, "end": 184, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaMath/withRespectTo", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "cite", "start": 206, "end": 210, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:00qpy9f50", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "orbital motion", "start": 293, "end": 307, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1179", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "Earth-Moon System", "start": 395, "end": 412, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:436", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "calibration", "start": 457, "end": 468, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:2179", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "Neogene", "start": 476, "end": 483, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:stateTimeGeologic/Neogene", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "cite", "start": 508, "end": 512, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:00qpy9f50", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "span", "start": 700, "end": 704, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:052matx73", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "orbits", "start": 735, "end": 741, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1184", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "precise", "start": 753, "end": 760, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:04rqt6703", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "Earth", "start": 782, "end": 787, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05byh2e17", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "most", "start": 811, "end": 815, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01d0zv889", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "span", "start": 903, "end": 907, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:052matx73", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "time interval", "start": 975, "end": 988, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:propTime/TimeInterval", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "most", "start": 994, "end": 998, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01d0zv889", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "due to", "start": 1080, "end": 1086, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaSci/dueTo", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "dissipation", "start": 1093, "end": 1104, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:procWave/Dissipation", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "due to", "start": 1183, "end": 1189, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaSci/dueTo", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "cite", "start": 1245, "end": 1249, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:00qpy9f50", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "calibration", "start": 1272, "end": 1283, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:2179", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "Mesozoic", "start": 1291, "end": 1299, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:stateTimeGeologic/Mesozoic", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "eccentricity", "start": 1389, "end": 1401, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:441", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "related to", "start": 1403, "end": 1413, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaSci/relatedTo", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "Mesozoic", "start": 1593, "end": 1601, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:stateTimeGeologic/Mesozoic", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}]}

{"bibcode": "2001ApJ...556..121K", "title": "Theoretical Modeling of Starburst Galaxies", "abstract": "We have modeled a large sample of infrared starburst galaxies using both the PEGASE v2.0 and STARBURST99 codes to generate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the young star clusters. PEGASE utilizes the Padova group tracks, while STARBURST99 uses the Geneva group tracks, allowing comparison between the two. We used our MAPPINGS III code to compute photoionization models that include a self-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We use the standard optical diagnostic diagrams as indicators of the hardness of the EUV radiation field in these galaxies. These diagnostic diagrams are most sensitive to the spectral index of the ionizing radiation field in the 1-4 ryd region. We find that warm infrared starburst galaxies contain a relatively hard EUV field in this region. The PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in the 1-4 ryd range than that of STARBURST99. As the spectrum in this regime is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, this discrepancy is most likely due to the differences in stellar atmosphere models used for the W-R stars. The PEGASE models use the Clegg &amp; Middlemass planetary nebula nuclei (PNN) atmosphere models for the W-R stars, whereas the STARBURST99 models use the Schmutz, Leitherer, &amp; Gruenwald W-R atmosphere models. We believe that the Schmutz et al. atmospheres are more applicable to the starburst galaxies in our sample; however, they do not produce the hard EUV field in the 1-4 ryd region required by our observations.

PEGASE utilizes the Padova group tracks, while STARBURST99 uses the Geneva group tracks, allowing comparison between the two. We used our MAPPINGS III code to compute photoionization models that include a self-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We use the standard optical diagnostic diagrams as indicators of the hardness of the EUV radiation field in these galaxies. These diagnostic diagrams are most sensitive to the spectral index of the ionizing radiation field in the 1-4 ryd region. We find that warm infrared starburst galaxies contain a relatively hard EUV field in this region. The PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in the 1-4 ryd range than that of STARBURST99. As the spectrum in this regime is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, this discrepancy is most likely due to the differences in stellar atmosphere models used for the W-R stars. The PEGASE models use the Clegg & Middlemass planetary nebula nuclei (PNN) atmosphere models for the W-R stars, whereas the STARBURST99 models use the Schmutz, Leitherer, & Gruenwald W-R atmosphere models. We believe that the Schmutz et al. atmospheres are more applicable to the starburst galaxies in our sample; however, they do not produce the hard EUV field in the 1-4 ryd region required by our observations.

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data.

(1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often-quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self-consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach.

The diagnostic methods used to measure SFRs are also reviewed, and a self-consistent set of SFR calibrations is presented as an aid to workers in the field.", "database": ["astronomy"], "keywords": ["Astrophysics"], "year": "1998", "doctype": "article", "citation_count": 6365, "domain_category": "astronomy", "spans": [{"surface": "star formation", "start": 16, "end": 30, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1569", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "galaxies", "start": 47, "end": 55, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:573", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "clues", "start": 70, "end": 75, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05y9abj60", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "Hubble sequence", "start": 106, "end": 121, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:757", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "galaxies", "start": 174, "end": 182, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:573", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "focus", "start": 188, "end": 193, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:000k53a93", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "star formation", "start": 241, "end": 255, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1569", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "galaxies", "start": 270, "end": 278, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:573", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "Hubble sequence", "start": 289, "end": 304, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:757", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "galaxy evolution", "start": 346, "end": 362, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:594", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "drive", "start": 395, "end": 400, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05yj2y557", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "Star formation", "start": 416, "end": 430, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1569", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "galaxies", "start": 467, "end": 475, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:573", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "framework", "start": 545, "end": 554, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:0235g7a39", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "methods", "start": 571, "end": 578, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1043", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "self", "start": 625, "end": 629, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01dj1q121", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}]}

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer.

A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases.

{"bibcode": "2009ApJS..180..330K", "title": "Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe Observations: Cosmological Interpretation", "abstract": "The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5-year data provide stringent limits on deviations from the minimal, six-parameter Λ cold dark matter model. We report these limits and use them to constrain the physics of cosmic inflation via Gaussianity, adiabaticity, the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations, gravitational waves, and spatial curvature. We also constrain models of dark energy via its equation of state, parity-violating interaction, and neutrino properties, such as mass and the number of species. We detect no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The six parameters and the corresponding 68% uncertainties, derived from the WMAP data combined with the distance measurements from the Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies, are: Ω<SUB> b </SUB> h <SUP>2</SUP> = 0.02267<SUP>+0.00058</SUP> <SUB>-0.00059</SUB>, Ω<SUB> c </SUB> h <SUP>2</SUP> = 0.1131 ± 0.0034, Ω<SUB>Λ</SUB> = 0.726 ± 0.015, n<SUB>s</SUB> = 0.960 ± 0.013, τ = 0.084 ± 0.016, and Δ_{R}^2 = (2.445± 0.096)× 10^{-9} at k = 0.002 Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>.

We report these limits and use them to constrain the physics of cosmic inflation via Gaussianity, adiabaticity, the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations, gravitational waves, and spatial curvature. We also constrain models of dark energy via its equation of state, parity-violating interaction, and neutrino properties, such as mass and the number of species. We detect no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The six parameters and the corresponding 68% uncertainties, derived from the WMAP data combined with the distance measurements from the Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies, are: Ω b h 2 = 0.02267+0.00058 -0.00059, Ω c h 2 = 0.1131 ± 0.0034, ΩΛ = 0.726 ± 0.015, ns = 0.960 ± 0.013, τ = 0.084 ± 0.016, and Δ_{R}^2 = (2.445± 0.096)× 10^{-9} at k = 0.002 Mpc-1. From these, we derive σ8 = 0.812 ± 0.026, H 0 = 70.5 ± 1.3 km s-1 Mpc-1, Ω b = 0.0456 ± 0.0015, Ω c = 0.228 ± 0.013, Ω m h 2 = 0.1358+0.0037 -0.0036, z reion = 10.9 ± 1.4, and t 0 = 13.72 ± 0.12 Gyr. With the WMAP data combined with BAO and SN, we find the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r < 0.22(95%CL), and that ns > 1 is disfavored even when gravitational waves are included, which constrains the models of inflation that can produce significant gravitational waves, such as chaotic or power-law inflation models, or a blue spectrum, such as hybrid inflation models. We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) equation of state of dark energy and the spatial curvature of the universe: -0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12(95%CL) and -0.0179 < Ω k < 0.0081(95%CL). We provide a set of \"WMAP distance priors,\" to test a variety of dark energy models with spatial curvature. We test a time-dependent w with a present value constrained as -0.33 < 1 + w 0 < 0.21 (95% CL). Temperature and dark matter fluctuations are found to obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9% and 2.1% for the axion-type and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively. The power spectra of TB and EB correlations constrain a parity-violating interaction, which rotates the polarization angle and converts E to B. The polarization angle could not be rotated more than -5fdg9 < Δα < 2fdg4 (95% CL) between the decoupling and the present epoch. We find the limit on the total mass of massive neutrinos of ∑m ν < 0.67 eV(95%CL), which is free from the uncertainty in the normalization of the large-scale structure data. The number of relativistic degrees of freedom (dof), expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is constrained as N eff = 4.4 ± 1.5 (68%), consistent with the standard value of 3.04.

Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at λ&gt;~40 μm. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T~40-55 K (warm dust) and T~20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ɛ=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to ~150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 μm and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 μm is ~1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy.

The purpose of this letter is to show that this indeed may be the case: it seems that any black hole will create and emit particles such as neutrinos or photons at just the rate that one would expect if the black hole was a body with a temperature of (κ/2π) (ħ/2k) ~ 10<SUP>-6</SUP> (Msolar/M)K where κ is the surface gravity of the black hole<SUP>1</SUP>.

The purpose of this letter is to show that this indeed may be the case: it seems that any black hole will create and emit particles such as neutrinos or photons at just the rate that one would expect if the black hole was a body with a temperature of (κ/2π) (ħ/2k) ~ 10-6 (Msolar/M)K where κ is the surface gravity of the black hole1. As a black hole emits this thermal radiation one would expect it to lose mass. This in turn would increase the surface gravity and so increase the rate of emission. The black hole would therefore have a finite life of the order of 1071 (Msolar/M)-3 s. For a black hole of solar mass this is much longer than the age of the Universe. There might, however, be much smaller black holes which were formed by fluctuations in the early Universe2. Any such black hole of mass less than 1015 g would have evaporated by now. Near the end of its life the rate of emission would be very high and about 1030 erg would be released in the last 0.1 s. This is a fairly small explosion by astronomical standards but it is equivalent to about 1 million 1 Mton hydrogen bombs.", "database": ["astronomy", "physics", "general"], "keywords": [], "year": "1974", "doctype": "article", "citation_count": 4884, "domain_category": "astronomy", "spans": [{"surface": "QUANTUM", "start": 0, "end": 7, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:00dkdd931", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "black holes", "start": 100, "end": 111, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:162", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "horizon", "start": 204, "end": 211, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:2339", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "very", "start": 215, "end": 219, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Mars/6364", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "large", "start": 220, "end": 225, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:028nd8457", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "Planck", "start": 242, "end": 248, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/4749", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "quantum", "start": 305, "end": 312, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:00dkdd931", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "energy density", "start": 395, "end": 409, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:propEnergy/EnergyDensity", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "gravitational field", "start": 438, "end": 457, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/SOLID_EARTH/GRAVITY/GRAVITATIONAL_FIELD/GRAVITATIONAL_FIELD", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "quantum", "start": 517, "end": 524, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:00dkdd931", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "very", "start": 671, "end": 675, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Mars/6364", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "Planck", "start": 697, "end": 703, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/4749", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "black", "start": 810, "end": 815, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/762", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "create", "start": 826, "end": 832, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:022pakb16", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "just", "start": 884, "end": 888, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05brr5h08", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "black", "start": 927, "end": 932, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/762", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "surface gravity", "start": 1019, "end": 1034, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1669", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "black", "start": 1042, "end": 1047, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/762", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "black", "start": 1060, "end": 1065, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/762", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "surface gravity", "start": 1166, "end": 1181, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1669", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "black", "start": 1224, "end": 1229, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/762", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "life", "start": 1265, "end": 1269, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:012rp6f89", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "black", "start": 1313, "end": 1318, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/762", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "solar mass", "start": 1327, "end": 1337, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1506", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "black holes", "start": 1426, "end": 1437, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:162", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "black", "start": 1505, "end": 1510, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/762", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "less than", "start": 1524, "end": 1533, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaMath/lessThan", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "Near", "start": 1571, "end": 1575, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:04j9nyn50", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "end of", "start": 1580, "end": 1586, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaTime/endOf", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "life", "start": 1591, "end": 1595, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:012rp6f89", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "very", "start": 1626, "end": 1630, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Mars/6364", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "last", "start": 1680, "end": 1684, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/3289", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}]}

About 90% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r ∼ 27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion.

On the basis of this effect, we argue that these models could reconcile the low dynamical estimates of the mean mass density with the negligibly small spatial curvature preferred by inflation.", "database": ["astronomy", "physics"], "keywords": ["98.80.Bp", "11.10.Ef", "12.25.+e", "98.80.Dr", "Origin and formation of the Universe", "Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approach"], "year": "1988", "doctype": "article", "citation_count": 4065, "domain_category": "astronomy", "spans": [{"surface": "self", "start": 55, "end": 59, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01dj1q121", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "scalar field", "start": 85, "end": 97, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:reprMathFunction/ScalarField", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "models", "start": 128, "end": 134, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE_SERVICES/MODELS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "energy density", "start": 148, "end": 162, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:propEnergy/EnergyDensity", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "scalar field", "start": 170, "end": 182, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:reprMathFunction/ScalarField", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "models", "start": 237, "end": 243, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE_SERVICES/MODELS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "scalar", "start": 278, "end": 284, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:reprMath/Scalar", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "estimates", "start": 325, "end": 334, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:03dxs3n54", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "zero", "start": 375, "end": 379, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:03j5ebv52", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "scalar", "start": 412, "end": 418, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:reprMath/Scalar", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "magnitude", "start": 469, "end": 478, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:999", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "scalar field", "start": 499, "end": 511, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:reprMathFunction/ScalarField", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "models", "start": 637, "end": 643, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE_SERVICES/MODELS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "gravitation", "start": 687, "end": 698, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:661", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "Eötvös", "start": 711, "end": 717, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/1893", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "scalar field", "start": 776, "end": 788, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:reprMathFunction/ScalarField", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "Nucleosynthesis", "start": 825, "end": 840, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1131", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "perturbation theory", "start": 899, "end": 918, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1215", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "differ", "start": 997, "end": 1003, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:03w5dn804", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "scalar", "start": 1105, "end": 1111, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:reprMath/Scalar", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "energy density", "start": 1118, "end": 1132, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:propEnergy/EnergyDensity", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "energy density", "start": 1215, "end": 1229, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:propEnergy/EnergyDensity", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "scalar field", "start": 1237, "end": 1249, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:reprMathFunction/ScalarField", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "gravitational fields", "start": 1298, "end": 1318, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:667", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "scalar", "start": 1376, "end": 1382, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:reprMath/Scalar", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "basis", "start": 1414, "end": 1419, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:04k3q6a72", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "models", "start": 1456, "end": 1462, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE_SERVICES/MODELS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "reconcile", "start": 1469, "end": 1478, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05jh6j253", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "estimates", "start": 1497, "end": 1506, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:03dxs3n54", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "mean mass density", "start": 1514, "end": 1531, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1020", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}]}

We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. <BR /> Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results. <BR /> Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. <BR /> Results: Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources.

Graphite was a necessary component of any good mixture, but it could be used with any of the other materials. The particle size distributions are roughly power law in nature, with an exponent of about -3.3 to -3.6. The size range for graphite is about 0.005 μm to about 1 μm. The size distribution for the other materials is also approximately power law in nature, with the same exponent, but there is a narrower range of sizes: about 0.025-0.25 μm, depending on the material. The number of large particles is not well determined, because they are gray. Similarly, the number of small particles is not well determined because they are in the Rayleigh limit. This power-law distribution is drastically different from an Oort-van de Hulst distribution, which is much more slowly varying for small particles but drops much faster for particles larger than average. <P />The extinction was also fitted with spherical graphite particles plus cylinders of each of the other materials. Linear and circular polarizations were then determined for the cylinders on the assumption of Davis-Greenstein alignment. The extinction was quite satisfactory, but the linear polarization reached a maximum in the ultraviolet (about 1600 Å). This is because the mixture contains many small particles. Ifthe small particles are not elongated or aligned, the wavelength dependence of the polarization can be fitted, but the larger particles which are aligned do not provide enough polarization per magnitude of extinction. However, a fit to polarization and extinction can be achieved if the material responsible for the polarization contributes only a small part of the extinction but consists of fairly large particles and is very well aligned.

The particle size distributions are roughly power law in nature, with an exponent of about -3.3 to -3.6. The size range for graphite is about 0.005 μm to about 1 μm. The size distribution for the other materials is also approximately power law in nature, with the same exponent, but there is a narrower range of sizes: about 0.025-0.25 μm, depending on the material. The number of large particles is not well determined, because they are gray. Similarly, the number of small particles is not well determined because they are in the Rayleigh limit. This power-law distribution is drastically different from an Oort-van de Hulst distribution, which is much more slowly varying for small particles but drops much faster for particles larger than average. The extinction was also fitted with spherical graphite particles plus cylinders of each of the other materials. Linear and circular polarizations were then determined for the cylinders on the assumption of Davis-Greenstein alignment. The extinction was quite satisfactory, but the linear polarization reached a maximum in the ultraviolet (about 1600 Å). This is because the mixture contains many small particles. Ifthe small particles are not elongated or aligned, the wavelength dependence of the polarization can be fitted, but the larger particles which are aligned do not provide enough polarization per magnitude of extinction. However, a fit to polarization and extinction can be achieved if the material responsible for the polarization contributes only a small part of the extinction but consists of fairly large particles and is very well aligned. Dielectric particles with coatings could also provide the polarization.

The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black-carbon-rich sources are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both black carbon and co-emitted organic carbon. In prioritizing potential black-carbon mitigation actions, non-science factors, such as technical feasibility, costs, policy design, and implementation feasibility play important roles. The major sources of black carbon are presently in different stages with regard to the feasibility for near-term mitigation. This assessment, by evaluating the large number and complexity of the associated physical and radiative processes in black-carbon climate forcing, sets a baseline from which to improve future climate forcing estimates.", "database": ["physics", "earth science"], "keywords": ["black carbon", "climate forcing", "aerosol"], "year": "2013", "doctype": "article", "citation_count": 4045,

{"bibcode": "1996RSEnv..58..257G", "title": "NDWI-A normalized difference water index for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space", "abstract": "The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 μm and a near-IR channel around 0.86 μm. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as (ϱ(0.86 μm) - ϱ(1.24 μ m))/(ϱ(0.86 μ m) + ϱ(1.24 μ m)), where ϱ represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-μm and the 1.24-μm channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 μm is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 μm is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption.

This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 μm and a near-IR channel around 0.86 μm. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as (ϱ(0.86 μm) - ϱ(1.24 μ m))/(ϱ(0.86 μ m) + ϱ(1.24 μ m)), where ϱ represents the radiance in reflectance units.

{"bibcode": "2005EcoM...75....3H", "title": "Effects of Biodiversity on Ecosystem Functioning: a Consensus of Current Knowledge", "abstract": "Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further.

{"bibcode": "2005OcMod...9..347S", "title": "The regional oceanic modeling system (ROMS): a split-explicit, free-surface, topography-following-coordinate oceanic model", "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to find a combination of optimal numerical algorithms for time-stepping and mode-splitting suitable for a high-resolution, free-surface, terrain-following coordinate oceanic model. Due to mathematical feedback between the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations and, similarly, between the barotropic momentum and continuity equations, it is advantageous to treat both modes so that, after a time step for the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and vice versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step simultaneously. This leads to a new family of time-stepping algorithms that combine forward-backward feedback with the best known synchronous algorithms, allowing an increased time step due to the enhanced internal stability without sacrificing its accuracy. Based on these algorithms we design a split-explicit hydrodynamic kernel for a realistic oceanic model, which addresses multiple numerical issues associated with mode splitting. This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of the barotropic mode via a specially designed filter function to guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers and yields more accurate (up to second-order), resolved barotropic processes, while preventing aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals into the slow baroclinic motions. It has a more accurate mode-splitting due to redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for the local variations in density field, while maintaining the computational efficiency of a split model. It is naturally compatible with a variety of centered and upstream-biased high-order advection algorithms, and helps to mitigate computational cost of expensive physical parameterization of mixing processes and submodels.", "abstract_clean": "The purpose of this study is to find a combination of optimal numerical algorithms for time-stepping and mode-splitting suitable for a high-resolution, free-surface, terrain-following coordinate oceanic model.

Two distinct regimes are identified: ocean mixing in the boundary layer near the surface under a variety of surface forcing conditions (stabilizing, destabilizing, and wind driven), and mixing in the ocean interior due to internal waves, shear instability, and double diffusion (arising from the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt). Mixing schemes commonly applied to the upper ocean are shown not to contain some potentially important boundary layer physics. Therefore a new parameterization of oceanic boundary layer mixing is developed to accommodate some of this physics. It includes a scheme for determining the boundary layer depth h, where the turbulent contribution to the vertical shear of a bulk Richardson number is parameterized. Expressions for diffusivity and nonlocal transport throughout the boundary layer are given. The diffusivity is formulated to agree with similarity theory of turbulence in the surface layer and is subject to the conditions that both it and its vertical gradient match the interior values at h. This nonlocal \"K profile parameterization\" (KPP) is then verified and compared to alternatives, including its atmospheric counterparts. Its most important feature is shown to be the capability of the boundary layer to penetrate well into a stable thermocline in both convective and wind-driven situations. The diffusivities of the aforementioned three interior mixing processes are modeled as constants, functions of a gradient Richardson number (a measure of the relative importance of stratification to destabilizing shear), and functions of the double-diffusion density ratio, R<SUB>ρ</SUB>. Oceanic simulations of convective penetration, wind deepening, and diurnal cycling are used to determine appropriate values for various model parameters as weak functions of vertical resolution. Annual cycle simulations at ocean weather station Papa for 1961 and 1969-1974 are used to test the complete suite of parameterizations. Model and observed temperatures at all depths are shown to agree very well into September, after which systematic advective cooling in the ocean produces expected differences. It is argued that this cooling and a steady salt advection into the model are needed to balance the net annual surface heating and freshwater input. With these advections, good multiyear simulations of temperature and salinity can be achieved. These results and KPP simulations of the diurnal cycle at the Long-Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) site are compared with the results of other models. It is demonstrated that the KPP model exchanges properties between the mixed layer and thermocline in a manner consistent with observations, and at least as well or better than alternatives.", "abstract_clean": "If model parameterizations of unresolved physics, such as the variety of upper ocean mixing processes, are to hold over the large range of time and space scales of importance to climate, they must be strongly physically based.

{"bibcode": "2016Natur.540..418P", "title": "High-resolution mapping of global surface water and its long-term changes", "abstract": "The location and persistence of surface water (inland and coastal) is both affected by climate and human activity and affects climate, biological diversity and human wellbeing. Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions, statistical extrapolation of regional data and satellite imagery, but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images, we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss.

Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions, statistical extrapolation of regional data and satellite imagery, but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images, we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss.

They are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about largely through human transport and commerce. In a world without borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these immigrations. The fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. Few survive the hazards of chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become naturalized. In turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. There are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. Ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. Whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) Animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) Plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species. (3) In agriculture, the principal pests of temperate crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and crop losses constitute an onerous \"tax\" on food, fiber, and forage production. (4) The global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable. Identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and establishment constitutes an enormous challenge to both conservation and international commerce. Detection and management when exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) Efforts to identify general attributes of future invaders have often been inconclusive. (2) Predicting susceptible locales for future invasions seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates of arrival among potential invaders. (3) Eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy. Successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) Control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term, ecosystem-wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on battling individual invaders. (5) Prevention of invasions is much less costly than post-entry control. Revamping national and international quarantine laws by adopting a \"guilty until proven innocent\" approach would be a productive first step. Failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions, disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous, impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. Given their current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of global change. Left unchecked, they will influence these other forces in profound but still unpredictable ways.", "abstract_clean": "Biotic invaders are species that establish a new range in which they proliferate, spread, and persist to the detriment of the environment.

There are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. Ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. Whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) Animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) Plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species. (3) In agriculture, the principal pests of temperate crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and crop losses constitute an onerous \"tax\" on food, fiber, and forage production. (4) The global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable. Identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and establishment constitutes an enormous challenge to both conservation and international commerce. Detection and management when exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) Efforts to identify general attributes of future invaders have often been inconclusive. (2) Predicting susceptible locales for future invasions seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates of arrival among potential invaders. (3) Eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy. Successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) Control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term, ecosystem-wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on battling individual invaders. (5) Prevention of invasions is much less costly than post-entry control. Revamping national and international quarantine laws by adopting a \"guilty until proven innocent\" approach would be a productive first step. Failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions, disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous, impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. Given their current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of global change. Left unchecked, they will influence these other forces in profound but still unpredictable ways.", "database": ["earth science"], "keywords": ["alien species", "biological control", "biotic invaders", "eradication", "global change", "immigration", "invasion", "naturalization", "nonindigenous", "pests", "weeds"], "year": "2000", "doctype": "article", "citation_count": 2956, "domain_category": "earth_science", "spans": [{"surface": "Biotic", "start": 0, "end": 6, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:stateBiological/Biotic", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "most", "start": 152, "end": 156, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01d0zv889", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "earth", "start": 249, "end": 254, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05byh2e17", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "biota", "start": 257, "end": 262, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:realmBiolBiome/Biota", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "world", "start": 328, "end": 333, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:04yvx5a03", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "escape", "start": 688, "end": 694, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01dthb180", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "biotic", "start": 852, "end": 858, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:stateBiological/Biotic", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "foster", "start": 953, "end": 959, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/1999", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "self", "start": 997, "end": 1001, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01dj1q121", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "biotic", "start": 1055, "end": 1061, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:stateBiological/Biotic", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "predation", "start": 1207, "end": 1216, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:phenEcology/Predation", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "habitat", "start": 1244, "end": 1251, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:03n103c50", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "alter", "start": 1298, "end": 1303, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:00z51kw68", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "fire", "start": 1308, "end": 1312, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:03j7zd787", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "nutrient cycling", "start": 1321, "end": 1337, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/BIOSPHERE/ECOLOGICAL_DYNAMICS/ECOSYSTEM_FUNCTIONS/NUTRIENT_CYCLING", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "hydrology", "start": 1339, "end": 1348, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:humanKnowledgeDomain/Hydrology", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "agriculture", "start": 1468, "end": 1479, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/AGRICULTURE", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "pest", "start": 1568, "end": 1572, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:0117rgr12", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "cost", "start": 1679, "end": 1683, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01bstzn19", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "caused by", "start": 1722, "end": 1731, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaSci/causedBy", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "conservation", "start": 1978, "end": 1990, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/HUMAN_DIMENSIONS/ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACTS/CONSERVATION", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "Detection", "start": 2019, "end": 2028, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1911", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "biotic", "start": 2617, "end": 2623, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:stateBiological/Biotic", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "most", "start": 2637, "end": 2641, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01d0zv889", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "wide", "start": 2691, "end": 2695, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05qgc7m36", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "less", "start": 2814, "end": 2818, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:02rxw4j53", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "post", "start": 2831, "end": 2835, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:02ejjtg26", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "first", "start": 2980, "end": 2985, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:016dza536", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "biotic", "start": 3024, "end": 3030, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:stateBiological/Biotic", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "ecosystems", "start": 3337, "end": 3347, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/BIOSPHERE/ECOSYSTEMS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "biotic", "start": 3409, "end": 3415, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:stateBiological/Biotic", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "global change", "start": 3527, "end": 3540, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:phenPlanetClimate/GlobalChange", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}]}

We have developed a global model to estimate emissions of volatile organic compounds from natural sources (NVOC). Methane is not considered here and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere. The model has a highly resolved spatial grid (0.5°×0.5° latitude/longitude) and generates hourly average emission estimates. Chemical species are grouped into four categories: isoprene, monoterpenes, other reactive VOC (ORVOC), and other VOC (OVOC). NVOC emissions from oceans are estimated as a function of geophysical variables from a general circulation model and ocean color satellite data. Emissions from plant foliage are estimated from ecosystem specific biomass and emission factors and algorithms describing light and temperature dependence of NVOC emissions. Foliar density estimates are based on climatic variables and satellite data. Temporal variations in the model are driven by monthly estimates of biomass and temperature and hourly light estimates. The annual global VOC flux is estimated to be 1150 Tg C, composed of 44% isoprene, 11% monoterpenes, 22.5% other reactive VOC, and 22.5% other VOC. Large uncertainties exist for each of these estimates and particularly for compounds other than isoprene and monoterpenes. Tropical woodlands (rain forest, seasonal, drought-deciduous, and savanna) contribute about half of all global natural VOC emissions.

Models of continental growth, continental composition, convergent margin magmatism and mantle heterogeneity all require a better understanding of the mass and chemical fluxes associated with subducting sediments. We have evaluated subducting sediments on a global basis in order to better define their chemical systematics and to determine both regional and global average compositions. We then use these compositions to assess the importance of sediments to arc volcanism and crust-mantle recycling, and to re-evaluate the chemical composition of the continental crust. The large variations in the chemical composition of marine sediments are for the most part linked to the main lithological constituents. The alkali elements (K, Rb and Cs) and high field strength elements (Ti, Nb, Hf, Zr) are closely linked to the detrital phase in marine sediments; Th is largely detrital but may be enriched in the hydrogenous Fe-Mn component of sediments; REE patterns are largely continental, but abundances are closely linked to fish debris phosphate; U is mostly detrital, but also dependent on the supply and burial rate of organic matter; Ba is linked to both biogenic barite and hydrothermal components; Sr is linked to carbonate phases. Thus, the important geochemical tracers follow the lithology of the sediments. Sediment lithologies are controlled in turn by a small number of factors: proximity of detrital sources (volcanic and continental); biological productivity and preservation of carbonate and opal; and sedimentation rate. Because of the link with lithology and the wealth of lithological data routinely collected for ODP and DSDP drill cores, bulk geochemical averages can be calculated to better than 30% for most elements from fewer than ten chemical analyses for a typical drill core (100-1000 m). Combining the geochemical systematics with convergence rate and other parameters permits calculation of regional compositional fluxes for subducting sediment. These regional fluxes can be compared to the compositions of arc volcanics to asses the importance of sediment subduction to arc volcanism. For the 70% of the trenches worldwide where estimates can be made, the regional fluxes also provide the basis for a global subducting sediment (GLOSS) composition and flux. GLOSS is dominated by terrigenous material (76 wt% terrigenous, 7 wt% calcium carbonate, 10 wt% opal, 7 wt% mineral-bound H <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUP>+</SUP>), and therefore similar to upper continental crust (UCC) in composition. Exceptions include enrichment in Ba, Mn and the middle and heavy REE, and depletions in detrital elements diluted by biogenic material (alkalis, Th, Zr, Hf). Sr and Pb are identical in GLOSS and UCC as a result of a balance between dilution and enrichment by marine phases. GLOSS and the systematics of marine sediments provide an independent approach to the composition of the upper continental crust for detrital elements. Significant discrepancies of up to a factor of two exist between the marine sediment data and current upper crustal estimates for Cs, Nb, Ta and Ti. Suggested revisions to UCC include Cs (7.3 ppm), Nb (13.7 ppm), Ta (0.96 ppm) and TiO <SUB>2</SUB> (0.76 wt%). These revisions affect recent bulk continental crust estimates for La/Nb and U/Nb, and lead to an even greater contrast between the continents and mantle for these important trace element ratios. GLOSS and the regional sediment data also provide new insights into the mantle sources of oceanic basalts. The classical geochemical distinction between `pelagic' and `terrigenous' sediment sources is not valid and needs to be replaced by a more comprehensive understanding of the compositional variations in complete sedimentary columns. In addition, isotopic arguments based on surface sediments alone can lead to erroneous conclusions.

Part I: Month-to-Month Variability*.", "abstract": "The leading modes of variability of the extratropical circulation in both hemispheres are characterized by deep, zonally symmetric or `annular' structures, with geopotential height perturbations of opposing signs in the polar cap region and in the surrounding zonal ring centered near 45° latitude. The structure and dynamics of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode have been extensively documented, whereas the existence of a Northern Hemisphere (NH) mode, herein referred to as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), has only recently been recognized. Like the SH mode, the AO can be defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function of the sea level pressure field or of the zonally symmetric geopotential height or zonal wind fields. In this paper the structure and seasonality of the NH and SH modes are compared based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis and supplementary datasets.The structures of the NH and SH annular modes are shown to be remarkably similar, not only in the zonally averaged geopotential height and zonal wind fields, but in the mean meridional circulations as well. Both exist year-round in the troposphere, but they amplify with height upward into the stratosphere during those seasons in which the strength of the zonal flow is conducive to strong planetary wave-mean flow interaction: midwinter in the NH and late spring in the SH. During these `active seasons,' the annular modes modulate the strength of the Lagrangian mean circulation in the lower stratosphere, total column ozone and tropopause height over mid- and high latitudes, and the strength of the trade winds of their respective hemispheres. The NH mode also contains an embedded planetary wave signature with expressions in surface air temperature, precipitation, total column ozone, and tropopause height. It is argued that the horizontal temperature advection by the perturbed zonal-mean zonal wind field in the lower troposphere is instrumental in forcing this pattern.A companion paper documents the striking resemblance between the structure of the annular modes and observed climate trends over the past few decades.", "abstract_clean": "The leading modes of variability of the extratropical circulation in both hemispheres are characterized by deep, zonally symmetric or `annular' structures, with geopotential height perturbations of opposing signs in the polar cap region and in the surrounding zonal ring centered near 45° latitude.

Seafloor spreading rates and fault azimuths are used to determine the motions of 19 plates bordered by mid-ocean ridges, including all the major plates. Six smaller plates with little or no connection to the mid-ocean ridges are linked to MORVEL with GPS station velocities and azimuthal data. By design, almost no kinematic information is exchanged between the geologically determined and geodetically constrained subsets of the global circuit-MORVEL thus averages motion over geological intervals for all the major plates. Plate geometry changes relative to NUVEL-1A include the incorporation of Nubia, Lwandle and Somalia plates for the former Africa plate, Capricorn, Australia and Macquarie plates for the former Australia plate, and Sur and South America plates for the former South America plate. MORVEL also includes Amur, Philippine Sea, Sundaland and Yangtze plates, making it more useful than NUVEL-1A for studies of deformation in Asia and the western Pacific. Seafloor spreading rates are estimated over the past 0.78 Myr for intermediate and fast spreading centres and since 3.16 Ma for slow and ultraslow spreading centres. Rates are adjusted downward by 0.6-2.6mmyr<SUP>-1</SUP> to compensate for the several kilometre width of magnetic reversal zones. Nearly all the NUVEL-1A angular velocities differ significantly from the MORVEL angular velocities. The many new data, revised plate geometries, and correction for outward displacement thus significantly modify our knowledge of geologically current plate motions. MORVEL indicates significantly slower 0.78-Myr-average motion across the Nazca-Antarctic and Nazca-Pacific boundaries than does NUVEL-1A, consistent with a progressive slowdown in the eastward component of Nazca plate motion since 3.16 Ma. It also indicates that motions across the Caribbean-North America and Caribbean-South America plate boundaries are twice as fast as given by NUVEL-1A. Summed, least-squares differences between angular velocities estimated from GPS and those for MORVEL, NUVEL-1 and NUVEL-1A are, respectively, 260 per cent larger for NUVEL-1 and 50 per cent larger for NUVEL-1A than for MORVEL, suggesting that MORVEL more accurately describes historically current plate motions. Significant differences between geological and GPS estimates of Nazca plate motion and Arabia-Eurasia and India-Eurasia motion are reduced but not eliminated when using MORVEL instead of NUVEL-1A, possibly indicating that changes have occurred in those plate motions since 3.16 Ma. The MORVEL and GPS estimates of Pacific-North America plate motion in western North America differ by only 2.6 +/- 1.7mmyr<SUP>-1</SUP>, ~25 per cent smaller than for NUVEL-1A. The remaining difference for this plate pair, assuming there are no unrecognized systematic errors and no measurable change in Pacific-North America motion over the past 1-3 Myr, indicates deformation of one or more plates in the global circuit. Tests for closure of six three-plate circuits indicate that two, Pacific-Cocos-Nazca and Sur-Nubia-Antarctic, fail closure, with respective linear velocities of non-closure of 14 +/- 5 and 3 +/- 1mmyr<SUP>-1</SUP> (95 per cent confidence limits) at their triple junctions.

These observations are invertible to obtain useful information on both the internal viscoelastic structure of the solid Earth and on the detailed spatiotemporal characteristics of glaciation history. This review focuses upon the most recent advances that have been achieved in each of these areas, advances that have proven to be central to the construction of the refined model of the global process of glacial isostatic adjustment, denoted ICE-5G (VM2).

The observational results of the study are: (1) Large-amplitude, nonsinusoidal Alfvén waves propagating outward from the sun with a broad wavelength range from 10<SUP>3</SUP> to 5×10<SUP>6</SUP> km dominate the microscale structure at least 50% of the time; the waves frequently have energy densities comparable both to the unperturbed magnetic field energy density and to the thermal energy density. (2) The purest examples of these outwardly propagating Alfvén waves occur in high-velocity solar wind streams and on their trailing edges (where the velocity decreases slowly with time).

Second, in order to see magnetic effect on the structure, electric conductivity of a gas ionized by cosmic rays and radioactivities contained in dust grains is estimated for each region of the nebula and, then, the growth and decay of seed magnetic fields, which are due to differential rotation of the nebula and to the Joule dissipation, respectively, are calculated. The results indicate that, in regions of the terrestrial planets, magnetic fields decay much faster than they grow and magnetic effects can be ignored, except for the outermost layers of very low density. This is not the case for regions of Uranus and Neptune where magnetic fields can be amplified to considerable extents. Third, the transport of angular momentum due to magnetic and mechanical turbulent viscosities and the resultant redistribution of surface density in the nebula are investigated. The results show that the density redistribution occurs, in general, in a direction to attain a distribution of surface density which has nearly the same r-dependence as that obtained from the present distribution of the planetary mass.

Second, in order to see magnetic effect on the structure, electric conductivity of a gas ionized by cosmic rays and radioactivities contained in dust grains is estimated for each region of the nebula and, then, the growth and decay of seed magnetic fields, which are due to differential rotation of the nebula and to the Joule dissipation, respectively, are calculated. The results indicate that, in regions of the terrestrial planets, magnetic fields decay much faster than they grow and magnetic effects can be ignored, except for the outermost layers of very low density. This is not the case for regions of Uranus and Neptune where magnetic fields can be amplified to considerable extents.

The main characteristic that makes this set of isochrones very valuable is based on their extension in mass and chemical composition, besides the calculation of late stages of evolution, beyond the red giant tip till the white dwarf stage after the planetary nebula phase.", "database": ["astronomy"], "keywords": ["STARS: EVOLUTION", "INTERIORS", "FUNDAMENTAL PARAMETERS", "HR DIAGRAM"], "year": "1994", "doctype": "article", "citation_count": 1642, "domain_category": "planetary_science", "spans": [{"surface": "large", "start": 25, "end": 30, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:028nd8457", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "ages", "start": 204, "end": 208, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:055xb4311", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "models", "start": 291, "end": 297, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE_SERVICES/MODELS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "most", "start": 316, "end": 320, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01d0zv889", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "radiative", "start": 328, "end": 337, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:statePhysical/Radiative", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "chemical composition", "start": 423, "end": 443, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:224", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "based on", "start": 462, "end": 470, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaMath/basedOn", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "models", "start": 471, "end": 477, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE_SERVICES/MODELS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "radiative", "start": 498, "end": 507, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:statePhysical/Radiative", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "models", "start": 560, "end": 566, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE_SERVICES/MODELS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "zero age main sequence", "start": 589, "end": 611, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1843", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "ZAMS", "start": 613, "end": 617, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1843", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "carbon", "start": 634, "end": 640, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/OCEANS/OCEAN_CHEMISTRY/CARBON", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "massive stars", "start": 654, "end": 667, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:732", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "asymptotic giant branch", "start": 727, "end": 750, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:108", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "stars", "start": 796, "end": 801, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1634", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "bolometric", "start": 873, "end": 883, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:stateSpectralBand/Bolometric", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "luminosity function", "start": 975, "end": 994, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:942", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "Salpeter", "start": 1015, "end": 1023, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:matrMineral/Salpeter", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "together", "start": 1135, "end": 1143, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01azqfh67", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "main", "start": 1200, "end": 1204, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Mars/3596", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "very", "start": 1254, "end": 1258, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Mars/6364", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "based on", "start": 1271, "end": 1279, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaMath/basedOn", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "chemical composition", "start": 1308, "end": 1328, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:224", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "red giant tip", "start": 1394, "end": 1407, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1371", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "white", "start": 1417, "end": 1422, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/6534", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "nebula", "start": 1455, "end": 1461, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1095", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}]}

After a series of highly eccentric Earth orbits with apogees beyond the moon, each spacecraft used close flybys of the moon to escape into orbits about the Sun near 1 AU. Once in heliospheric orbit, one spacecraft trails Earth while the other leads. As viewed from the Sun, the two spacecraft separate at approximately 44 to 45 degrees per year. The purposes of the STEREO Mission are to understand the causes and mechanisms of coronal mass ejection (CME) initiation and to follow the propagation of CMEs through the inner heliosphere to Earth. Researchers will use STEREO measurements to study the mechanisms and sites of energetic particle acceleration and to develop three-dimensional (3-D) time-dependent models of the magnetic topology, temperature, density and velocity of the solar wind between the Sun and Earth. To accomplish these goals, each STEREO spacecraft is equipped with an almost identical set of optical, radio and in situ particles and fields instruments provided by U.S. and European investigators. The SECCHI suite of instruments includes two white light coronagraphs, an extreme ultraviolet imager and two heliospheric white light imagers which track CMEs out to 1 AU. The IMPACT suite of instruments measures in situ solar wind electrons, energetic electrons, protons and heavier ions. IMPACT also includes a magnetometer to measure the in situ magnetic field strength and direction. The PLASTIC instrument measures the composition of heavy ions in the ambient plasma as well as protons and alpha particles. The S/WAVES instrument uses radio waves to track the location of CME-driven shocks and the 3-D topology of open field lines along which flow particles produced by solar flares. Each of the four instrument packages produce a small real-time stream of selected data for purposes of predicting space weather events at Earth. NOAA forecasters at the Space Environment Center and others will use these data in their space weather forecasting and their resultant products will be widely used throughout the world.

The angular momentum transfer is shown to be so rapid that substantial changes in both the structure of the disk and the orbit of Jupiter must have taken place on a time scale of a few thousand years.", "database": ["astronomy"], "keywords": ["Jupiter (Planet)", "Momentum Transfer", "Natural Satellites", "Planetary Evolution", "Protoplanets", "Angular Momentum", "Celestial Mechanics", "Resonance", "Solar System", "Astronomy", "Jupiter:Protoplanetary Nebula", "Planetary Rings:Planetary Satellites"], "year": "1980", "doctype": "article", "citation_count": 1492, "domain_category": "planetary_science", "spans": [{"surface": "angular momentum", "start": 18, "end": 34, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:propRotation/AngularMomentum", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "angular momentum", "start": 156, "end": 172, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:propRotation/AngularMomentum", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "Lindblad", "start": 196, "end": 204, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/3409", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "eccentricity", "start": 275, "end": 287, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:441", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "interaction", "start": 388, "end": 399, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01pdc9z31", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "Jupiter", "start": 408, "end": 415, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:873", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "angular momentum", "start": 449, "end": 465, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:propRotation/AngularMomentum", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "Jupiter", "start": 575, "end": 582, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:873", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "must", "start": 583, "end": 587, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:054etzm63", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}]}

All of them are non-interacting systems, and so the stars should have evolved as if they were single. This sample more than doubles that of the earlier similar review by Andersen (Astron Astrophys Rev 3:91-126, 1991), extends the mass range at both ends and, for the first time, includes an extragalactic binary. In every case, we have examined the original data and recomputed the stellar parameters with a consistent set of assumptions and physical constants. To these we add interstellar reddening, effective temperature, metal abundance, rotational velocity and apsidal motion determinations when available, and we compute a number of other physical parameters, notably luminosity and distance. These accurate physical parameters reveal the effects of stellar evolution with unprecedented clarity, and we discuss the use of the data in observational tests of stellar evolution models in some detail. Earlier findings of significant structural differences between moderately fast-rotating, mildly active stars and single stars, ascribed to the presence of strong magnetic and spot activity, are confirmed beyond doubt. We also show how the best data can be used to test prescriptions for the subtle interplay between convection, diffusion, and other non-classical effects in stellar models. The amount and quality of the data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the systems in considerable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational synchronisation and orbital circularisation in greater detail than possible before. We show that the formulae for pseudo-synchronisation of stars in eccentric orbits predict the observed rotations quite well, except for very young and/or widely separated stars. Deviations do occur, however, especially for stars with convective envelopes. The superior data set finally demonstrates that apsidal motion rates as predicted from General Relativity plus tidal theory are in good agreement with the best observational data. No reliable binary data exist, which challenge General Relativity to any significant extent. The new data also enable us to derive empirical calibrations of M and R for single (post-) main-sequence stars above {0.6 M_{odot}}.

Examples include patterns in hydrodynamic systems such as thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures, Taylor-Couette flow, parametric-wave instabilities, as well as patterns in solidification fronts, nonlinear optics, oscillatory chemical reactions and excitable biological media. The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times. A unified description is developed, based on the linear instabilities of a homogeneous state, which leads naturally to a classification of patterns in terms of the characteristic wave vector q<SUB>0</SUB> and frequency ω<SUB>0</SUB> of the instability.

For many systems appropriate starting equations are either not known or too complicated to analyze conveniently. It is thus useful to introduce phenomenological order-parameter models, which lead to the correct amplitude equations near threshold, and which may be solved analytically or numerically in the nonlinear regime away from the instability. The above theoretical methods are useful in analyzing \"real pattern effects\" such as the influence of external boundaries, or the formation and dynamics of defects in ideal structures. An important element in nonequilibrium systems is the appearance of deterministic chaos. A greal deal is known about systems with a small number of degrees of freedom displaying \"temporal chaos,\" where the structure of the phase space can be analyzed in detail. For spatially extended systems with many degrees of freedom, on the other hand, one is dealing with spatiotemporal chaos and appropriate methods of analysis need to be developed. In addition to the general features of nonequilibrium pattern formation discussed above, detailed reviews of theoretical and experimental work on many specific systems are presented. These include Rayleigh-Bénard convection in a pure fluid, convection in binary-fluid mixtures, electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals, Taylor-Couette flow between rotating cylinders, parametric surface waves, patterns in certain open flow systems, oscillatory chemical reactions, static and dynamic patterns in biological media, crystallization fronts, and patterns in nonlinear optics.

An important element in nonequilibrium systems is the appearance of deterministic chaos. A greal deal is known about systems with a small number of degrees of freedom displaying \"temporal chaos,\" where the structure of the phase space can be analyzed in detail. For spatially extended systems with many degrees of freedom, on the other hand, one is dealing with spatiotemporal chaos and appropriate methods of analysis need to be developed. In addition to the general features of nonequilibrium pattern formation discussed above, detailed reviews of theoretical and experimental work on many specific systems are presented. These include Rayleigh-Bénard convection in a pure fluid, convection in binary-fluid mixtures, electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals, Taylor-Couette flow between rotating cylinders, parametric surface waves, patterns in certain open flow systems, oscillatory chemical reactions, static and dynamic patterns in biological media, crystallization fronts, and patterns in nonlinear optics.

It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the 'folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| &gt;0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction.

We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.", "database": ["physics"], "keywords": [], "year": "2006", "doctype": "article", "citation_count": 5015, "domain_category": "multidisciplinary", "spans": [{"surface": "neural networks", "start": 41, "end": 56, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1933", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "World", "start": 107, "end": 112, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:04yvx5a03", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "Wide", "start": 113, "end": 117, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05qgc7m36", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "large", "start": 172, "end": 177, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:028nd8457", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "units", "start": 220, "end": 225, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:02n742c10", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "first", "start": 231, "end": 236, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:016dza536", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "capture", "start": 249, "end": 256, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:04s6red60", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "nodes", "start": 328, "end": 333, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:04hp1ky92", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "units", "start": 358, "end": 363, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:02n742c10", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "links", "start": 375, "end": 380, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05ghgkk68", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "stand", "start": 381, "end": 386, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:04wfdx194", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "cope", "start": 458, "end": 462, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:00zwq4e04", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "basis", "start": 607, "end": 612, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:04k3q6a72", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "models", "start": 646, "end": 652, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE_SERVICES/MODELS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "arise", "start": 770, "end": 775, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05fnat077", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "large", "start": 841, "end": 846, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:028nd8457", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "study of", "start": 1016, "end": 1024, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaHuman/studyOf", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "ideas", "start": 1122, "end": 1127, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:054s8nj77", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}]}

Also added is a Bayesian method for estimating neutral evolutionary probabilities of alleles in a species using multispecies sequence alignments and a machine learning method to test for the autocorrelation of evolutionary rates in phylogenies. The computer memory requirements for the maximum likelihood analysis are reduced significantly through reprogramming, and the graphical user interface has been made more responsive and interactive for very big data sets. These enhancements will improve the user experience, quality of results, and the pace of biological discovery.

Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry.

Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry.

Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all.

Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios.
