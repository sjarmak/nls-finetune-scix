{"bibcode": "2001MNRAS.322..231K", "title": "On the variation of the initial mass function", "abstract_clean": "A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices α are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by Δα~0.5 between 0.1 and 1Msolar than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto & Zoccali; Paresce & De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; Méndez & Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.", "domain_category": "astronomy", "spans": [{"surface": "IMF", "start": 165, "end": 168, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.43}, {"surface": "star-forming conditions", "start": 174, "end": 197, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.833}, {"surface": "star formation", "start": 229, "end": 243, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5923}, {"surface": "average", "start": 269, "end": 276, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8529}, {"surface": "or Galactic-field IMF", "start": 277, "end": 298, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5081}, {"surface": "power-law index", "start": 364, "end": 379, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8269}, {"surface": "Msolar", "start": 408, "end": 414, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3524}, {"surface": "Poisson noise", "start": 591, "end": 604, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9913}, {"surface": "star clusters", "start": 636, "end": 649, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9785}, {"surface": "power-law index", "start": 736, "end": 751, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9057}, {"surface": "well", "start": 945, "end": 949, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.709}, {"surface": "power-law indices α", "start": 1027, "end": 1046, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.888}, {"surface": "unresolved", "start": 1100, "end": 1110, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5248}, {"surface": "single-star IMFs", "start": 1186, "end": 1202, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.975}, {"surface": "young star clusters", "start": 1207, "end": 1226, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9368}, {"surface": "Δα~", "start": 1257, "end": 1260, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3548}, {"surface": "1Msolar", "start": 1280, "end": 1287, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.496}, {"surface": "Galactic-field IMF", "start": 1297, "end": 1315, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9412}, {"surface": "5-Gyr-old stars", "start": 1358, "end": 1373, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5047}, {"surface": "The MFs", "start": 1375, "end": 1382, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.49}, {"surface": "globular clusters", "start": 1386, "end": 1403, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9636}, {"surface": "Galactic-field IMF", "start": 1462, "end": 1480, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9459}, {"surface": "Piotto", "start": 1482, "end": 1488, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5634}, {"surface": "Zoccali", "start": 1491, "end": 1498, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4018}, {"surface": "Paresce", "start": 1500, "end": 1507, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6995}, {"surface": "De March", "start": 1510, "end": 1518, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7489}, {"surface": "ancient white-dwarf candidates", "start": 1550, "end": 1580, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9953}, {"surface": "Galactic halo", "start": 1588, "end": 1601, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7247}, {"surface": "associated", "start": 1621, "end": 1631, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9135}, {"surface": "low-mass stars", "start": 1632, "end": 1646, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7915}, {"surface": "Ibata et", "start": 1648, "end": 1656, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9254}, {"surface": "Méndez", "start": 1662, "end": 1668, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8288}, {"surface": "Minniti", "start": 1671, "end": 1678, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7143}, {"surface": "Star formation", "start": 1743, "end": 1757, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8949}, {"surface": "higher metallicity environments", "start": 1761, "end": 1792, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4357}, {"surface": "low-mass stars", "start": 1833, "end": 1847, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9136}]}

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases.

Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million.

The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter ΛCDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter and energy densities, Ω b h 2, Ω c h 2, and ΩΛ, are each determined to a precision of ~1.5%. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5σ level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional ΛCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their ΛCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r < 0.13 (95% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to \\Omega _k = -0.0027^{+ 0.0039}_{- 0.0038}; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to ∑m ν < 0.44 eV (95% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N eff = 3.84 ± 0.40, when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.", "domain_category": "astronomy", "spans": [{"surface": "cosmological parameter constraints", "start": 11, "end": 45, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.991}, {"surface": "Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)", "start": 75, "end": 118, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4971}, {"surface": "WM", "start": 196, "end": 198, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6641}, {"surface": "six-parameter", "start": 273, "end": 286, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8901}, {"surface": "ΛCDM model", "start": 287, "end": 297, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.896}, {"surface": "WMAP", "start": 304, "end": 308, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7878}, {"surface": "the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the", "start": 348, "end": 402, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9464}, {"surface": "baryon acoustic oscillation scale,", "start": 403, "end": 437, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6228}, {"surface": "Hubble constant", "start": 446, "end": 461, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5705}, {"surface": "matter and energy densities", "start": 467, "end": 494, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.729}, {"surface": "Ω b h 2,", "start": 496, "end": 504, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7603}, {"surface": "Ω c h 2,", "start": 505, "end": 513, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6794}, {"surface": "ΩΛ,", "start": 518, "end": 521, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8491}, {"surface": "amplitude", "start": 571, "end": 580, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6231}, {"surface": "the", "start": 584, "end": 587, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.885}, {"surface": "primordial spectrum", "start": 588, "end": 607, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9201}, {"surface": "tilt", "start": 666, "end": 670, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7517}, {"surface": "primordial spectrum", "start": 678, "end": 697, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9043}, {"surface": "tilt", "start": 749, "end": 753, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9676}, {"surface": "allowable volume", "start": 852, "end": 868, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5517}, {"surface": "six-dimensional ΛCDM parameter space", "start": 876, "end": 912, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8144}, {"surface": "pre", "start": 947, "end": 950, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5783}, {"surface": "ΛCDM parameter", "start": 1035, "end": 1049, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9542}, {"surface": "six-parameter model", "start": 1105, "end": 1124, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8738}, {"surface": "fractional contribution", "start": 1157, "end": 1180, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4851}, {"surface": "tensor modes", "start": 1184, "end": 1196, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.976}, {"surface": "spatial curvature parameter", "start": 1234, "end": 1261, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7919}, {"surface": "\\Omega _k", "start": 1276, "end": 1285, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8692}, {"surface": "summed mass", "start": 1323, "end": 1334, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7206}, {"surface": "neutrinos", "start": 1338, "end": 1347, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7515}, {"surface": "∑m ν", "start": 1362, "end": 1366, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8688}, {"surface": "relativistic species", "start": 1405, "end": 1425, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9656}, {"surface": "N eff", "start": 1527, "end": 1532, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7174}, {"surface": "primordial helium abundance", "start": 1541, "end": 1568, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7474}, {"surface": "Y He", "start": 1570, "end": 1574, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7744}, {"surface": "standard big bang nucleosynthesis", "start": 1606, "end": 1639, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9487}, {"surface": "the", "start": 1682, "end": 1685, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9295}, {"surface": "Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect", "start": 1686, "end": 1711, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9523}, {"surface": "the", "start": 1795, "end": 1798, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5104}, {"surface": "polarization pattern", "start": 1799, "end": 1819, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9693}, {"surface": "temperature extrema", "start": 1827, "end": 1846, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9942}, {"surface": "standard cosmological model", "start": 1905, "end": 1932, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9273}, {"surface": "acoustic oscillations", "start": 1973, "end": 1994, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.996}, {"surface": "adiabatic initial conditions", "start": 1999, "end": 2027, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9879}]}

The six parameters and the corresponding 68% uncertainties, derived from the WMAP data combined with the distance measurements from the Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies, are: Ω b h 2 = 0.02267+0.00058 -0.00059, Ω c h 2 = 0.1131 ± 0.0034, ΩΛ = 0.726 ± 0.015, ns = 0.960 ± 0.013, τ = 0.084 ± 0.016, and Δ_{R}^2 = (2.445± 0.096)× 10^{-9} at k = 0.002 Mpc-1. From these, we derive σ8 = 0.812 ± 0.026, H 0 = 70.5 ± 1.3 km s-1 Mpc-1, Ω b = 0.0456 ± 0.0015, Ω c = 0.228 ± 0.013, Ω m h 2 = 0.1358+0.0037 -0.0036, z reion = 10.9 ± 1.4, and t 0 = 13.72 ± 0.12 Gyr. With the WMAP data combined with BAO and SN, we find the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r < 0.22(95%CL), and that ns > 1 is disfavored even when gravitational waves are included, which constrains the models of inflation that can produce significant gravitational waves, such as chaotic or power-law inflation models, or a blue spectrum, such as hybrid inflation models. We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) equation of state of dark energy and the spatial curvature of the universe: -0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12(95%CL) and -0.0179 < Ω k < 0.0081(95%CL). We provide a set of \"WMAP distance priors,\" to test a variety of dark energy models with spatial curvature. We test a time-dependent w with a present value constrained as -0.33 < 1 + w 0 < 0.21 (95% CL). Temperature and dark matter fluctuations are found to obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9% and 2.1% for the axion-type and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively. The power spectra of TB and EB correlations constrain a parity-violating interaction, which rotates the polarization angle and converts E to B. The polarization angle could not be rotated more than -5fdg9 < Δα < 2fdg4 (95% CL) between the decoupling and the present epoch. We find the limit on the total mass of massive neutrinos of ∑m ν < 0.67 eV(95%CL), which is free from the uncertainty in the normalization of the large-scale structure data. The number of relativistic degrees of freedom (dof), expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is constrained as N eff = 4.4 ± 1.5 (68%), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Finally, quantitative limits on physically-motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are -9 < f local NL < 111 (95% CL) and -151 < f equil NL < 253 (95% CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively.

{"bibcode": "2000ApJ...533..682C", "title": "The Dust Content and Opacity of Actively Star-forming Galaxies", "abstract_clean": "We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 μm of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at λ>~40 μm. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T~40-55 K (warm dust) and T~20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ɛ=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to ~150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 μm and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 μm is ~1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 μm is less than 15% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of ~2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z>~1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

Using data from previous editions, plus 2,873 new measurements from 758 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 118 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Neutrinos in Cosmology. Starting with this edition, the Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and all review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings. Review articles that were previously part of the Listings are now included in volume 1. The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (http://pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book.

It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the ~2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120° long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.", "domain_category": "astronomy", "spans": [{"surface": "the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)", "start": 49, "end": 84, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.8504}, {"surface": "the SDSS", "start": 134, "end": 142, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.4082}, {"surface": "SDSS", "start": 177, "end": 181, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3857}, {"surface": "imaging data", "start": 213, "end": 225, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5786}, {"surface": "five", "start": 360, "end": 364, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8844}, {"surface": "repeat photometry", "start": 440, "end": 457, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8496}, {"surface": "120° long,", "start": 463, "end": 473, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5895}, {"surface": "2fdg5 wide stripe", "start": 474, "end": 491, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4001}, {"surface": "celestial equator", "start": 502, "end": 519, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4777}, {"surface": "mag", "start": 686, "end": 689, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3932}, {"surface": "main", "start": 707, "end": 711, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4838}, {"surface": "spectroscopy", "start": 759, "end": 771, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3514}, {"surface": "120,", "start": 1012, "end": 1016, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.674}, {"surface": "460", "start": 1033, "end": 1036, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7722}, {"surface": "stellar photometry", "start": 1083, "end": 1101, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8672}, {"surface": "astrometry", "start": 1132, "end": 1142, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8014}, {"surface": "USNO CCD", "start": 1200, "end": 1208, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.4224}, {"surface": "bright end", "start": 1272, "end": 1282, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8031}, {"surface": "milliarcsecond", "start": 1289, "end": 1303, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4574}, {"surface": "bright galaxy photometry", "start": 1363, "end": 1387, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9849}, {"surface": "sky determination", "start": 1400, "end": 1417, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6193}, {"surface": "flat fielding", "start": 1598, "end": 1611, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8704}, {"surface": "wavelength calibration", "start": 1625, "end": 1647, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6986}, {"surface": "blue", "start": 1655, "end": 1659, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7544}, {"surface": "objects", "start": 1686, "end": 1693, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3695}, {"surface": "stellar metallicities", "start": 1772, "end": 1793, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8322}]}

The masses condense into aggregates which (when sufficiently bound) we identify as single particles of a larger mass. We propose that after this process has proceeded through several scales, the mass spectrum of condensations becomes \"self-similar\" and independent of the spectrum initially assumed. Some details of the self-similar distribution, and its evolution in time, can be calculated with the linear perturbation theory. Unlike other authors, we make no ad hoc assumptions about the spectrum of long-wavelength initial perturbatidns: the nonlinear N-body interactions of the mass points randomize their positions and generate a perturbation to all larger scales; this should fix the self-similar distribution almost uniquely. The results of numerical experiments on 1000 bodies are presented; these appear to show new nonlinear effects: condensations can \"bootstrap\" their way up in size faster than the linear theory predicts. Our self-similar model predicts relations between the masses and radii of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as well as their mass spectra. We compare the predictions with available data, and find some rather striking agreements. If the model is to explain galaxies, then isothermal \"seed\" masses of 3 x 1 0 M0 must have existed at recombination. To explain clusters of galaxies, the only necessary seeds are the galaxies themselves.

{"bibcode": "1974Natur.248...30H", "title": "Black hole explosions?", "abstract_clean": "QUANTUM gravitational effects are usually ignored in calculations of the formation and evolution of black holes. The justification for this is that the radius of curvature of space-time outside the event horizon is very large compared to the Planck length (Għ/c3)1/2 ~ 10-33 cm, the length scale on which quantum fluctuations of the metric are expected to be of order unity. This means that the energy density of particles created by the gravitational field is small compared to the space-time curvature. Even though quantum effects may be small locally, they may still, however, add up to produce a significant effect over the lifetime of the Universe ~ 1017 s which is very long compared to the Planck time ~ 10-43 s. The purpose of this letter is to show that this indeed may be the case: it seems that any black hole will create and emit particles such as neutrinos or photons at just the rate that one would expect if the black hole was a body with a temperature of (κ/2π) (ħ/2k) ~ 10-6 (Msolar/M)K where κ is the surface gravity of the black hole1. As a black hole emits this thermal radiation one would expect it to lose mass. This in turn would increase the surface gravity and so increase the rate of emission. The black hole would therefore have a finite life of the order of 1071 (Msolar/M)-3 s. For a black hole of solar mass this is much longer than the age of the Universe. There might, however, be much smaller black holes which were formed by fluctuations in the early Universe2. Any such black hole of mass less than 1015 g would have evaporated by now. Near the end of its life the rate of emission would be very high and about 1030 erg would be released in the last 0.1 s.

{"bibcode": "2003ApJS..148....1B", "title": "First-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Preliminary Maps and Basic Results", "abstract_clean": "We present full-sky microwave maps in five frequency bands (23-94 GHz) from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) first-year sky survey. Calibration errors are less than 0.5%, and the low systematic error level is well specified. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is separated from the foregrounds using multifrequency data. The sky maps are consistent with the 7° FWHM Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) maps. We report more precise, but consistent, dipole and quadrupole values. The CMB anisotropy obeys Gaussian statistics with -58<fNL<134 (95% confidence level [CL]). The 2<=l<=900 anisotropy power spectrum is cosmic-variance-limited for l<354, with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1 per mode to l=658. The temperature-polarization cross-power spectrum reveals both acoustic features and a large-angle correlation from reionization. The optical depth of reionization is τ=0.17+/-0.04, which implies a reionization epoch of tr=180+220-80 Myr (95% CL) after the big bang at a redshift of zr=20+10-9 (95% CL) for a range of ionization scenarios. This early reionization is incompatible with the presence of a significant warm dark matter density. A best-fit cosmological model to the CMB and other measures of large-scale structure works remarkably well with only a few parameters. The age of the best-fit universe is t0=13.7+/-0.2 Gyr. Decoupling was tdec=379+8-7 kyr after the big bang at a redshift of zdec=1089+/-1. The thickness of the decoupling surface was Δzdec=195+/-2. The matter density of the universe is Ωmh2=0.135+0.008-0.009, the baryon density is Ωbh2=0.0224+/-0.0009, and the total mass-energy of the universe is Ωtot=1.02+/-0.02. It appears that there may be progressively less fluctuation power on smaller scales, from WMAP to fine-scale CMB measurements to galaxies and finally to the Lyα forest. This may be accounted for with a running spectral index of scalar fluctuations, fitted as ns=0.93+/-0.03 at wavenumber k0=0.05 Mpc-1 (leff~700), with a slope of dns/dlnk=-0.031+0.016-0.018 in the best-fit model. (For WMAP data alone, ns=0.99+/-0.04.) This flat universe model is composed of 4.4% baryons, 22% dark matter, and 73% dark energy. The dark energy equation of state is limited to w<-0.78 (95% CL). Inflation theory is supported with ns~1, Ωtot~1, Gaussian random phases of the CMB anisotropy, and superhorizon fluctuations implied by the temperature-polarization anticorrelations at decoupling. An admixture of isocurvature modes does not improve the fit. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is r(k0=0.002Mpc-1)<0.90 (95% CL). The lack of CMB fluctuation power on the largest angular scales reported by COBE and confirmed by WMAP is intriguing. WMAP continues to operate, so results will improve.

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density.

{"bibcode": "1995PASP..107..803U", "title": "Unified Schemes for Radio-Loud Active Galactic Nuclei", "abstract_clean": "The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscrued by optically thick circumstellar matter, particularly at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. In radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit radio through gamma-ray light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anistropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which includes radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and general properties of AGN. We summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission caused by circumstellar obscuration and relativistic beaming. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking the high-luminosity sources (BL Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies). Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN and conclude they probably are powered by similar physical processes, at least within the relativistic jet. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this field.

{"bibcode": "2003RvMP...75..559P", "title": "The cosmological constant and dark energy", "abstract_clean": "Physics welcomes the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational effect approximates that of Einstein’s cosmological constant, Λ; today the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence. Physics also suggests that dark energy could be dynamical, allowing for the arguably appealing picture of an evolving dark-energy density approaching its natural value, zero, and small now because the expanding universe is old. This would alleviate the classical problem of the curious energy scale of a millielectron volt associated with a constant Λ. Dark energy may have been detected by recent cosmological tests. These tests make a good scientific case for the context, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lemaître model, in which the gravitational inverse-square law is applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one-quarter of the critical Einstein de Sitter value. The case for detection of dark energy is not yet as convincing but still serious; we await more data, which may be derived from work in progress. Planned observations may detect the evolution of the dark-energy density; a positive result would be a considerable stimulus for attempts at understanding the microphysics of dark energy.

LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pachón in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r ∼ 27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion.

{"bibcode": "2005ApJ...633..560E", "title": "Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Peak in the Large-Scale Correlation Function of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies", "abstract_clean": "We present the large-scale correlation function measured from a spectroscopic sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The survey region covers 0.72 h-3 Gpc3 over 3816 deg2 and 0.16<z<0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100 h-1 Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z~1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4% fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5% accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Ωmh2 to 8% and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Ωm=0.273+/-0.025+0.123(1+w0)+0.137ΩK.

A two-dimensional model is investigated where it is shown that using fermion-boson cancellation on the stress-energy tensor reduces the energy outflow to zero, while other noncovariant techniques give the Hawking result. A technique for replacing the collapse by boundary conditions on the past horizon is developed which retains the essential features of the collapse while eliminating some of the difficulties. This set of boundary conditions is also suggested as the most natural set for a preexistent black hole. The behavior of particle detectors under acceleration is investigated where it is shown that an accelerated detector even in flat spacetime will detect particles in the vacuum. The similarity of this case with the behavior of a detector near the black hole is brought out, and it is shown that a geodesic detector near the horizon will not see the Hawking flux of particles.

The Shadow of the Supermassive Black Hole", "abstract_clean": "When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow caused by gravitational light bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42 ± 3 μas, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a flux ratio ≳10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M = (6.5 ± 0.7) × 109 M ⊙. Our radio-wave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei.

Different representations of and relations between such theories are investigated. It is shown that some versions of the above theories may be consistent with local tests and may provide a qualitatively reasonable unified description of inflation with the dark energy epoch. The cosmological reconstruction of different modified gravities is provided in great detail.

A number of models in which the energy density of the scalar field red-shifts in a specific manner are studied. In these models the current epoch is chosen to be scalar-field dominated to agree with dynamical estimates of the density parameter, Ωdyn~0.2, and zero spatial curvature. The required scalar-field potential is ``nonlinear'' and decreases in magnitude as the value of the scalar field increases. A special solution of the field equations which is an attractive, time-dependent, fixed point is presented. These models are consistent with the classical tests of gravitation theory. The Eötvös-Dicke measurements strongly constrain the coupling of the scalar field to light (nongravitational) fields. Nucleosynthesis proceeds as in the standard hot big-bang model. In linear perturbation theory the behavior of baryonic perturbations, in the baryon-dominated epoch, do not differ significantly from the canonical scenario, while the presence of a substantial amount of homogeneous scalar-field energy density at low red-shifts inhibits the growth of perturbations in the baryonic fluid. The energy density in the scalar field is not appreciably perturbed by nonrelativistic gravitational fields, either in the radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, or scalar-field-dominated epochs. On the basis of this effect, we argue that these models could reconcile the low dynamical estimates of the mean mass density with the negligibly small spatial curvature preferred by inflation.", "domain_category": "astronomy", "spans": [{"surface": "pervasive, rolling, self-interacting, homogeneous scalar field", "start": 35, "end": 97, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8323}, {"surface": "the", "start": 166, "end": 169, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8302}, {"surface": "scalar field", "start": 170, "end": 182, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7475}, {"surface": "red-shifts", "start": 183, "end": 193, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4403}, {"surface": "current epoch", "start": 248, "end": 261, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8895}, {"surface": "scalar-field dominated", "start": 278, "end": 300, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.867}, {"surface": "dynamical", "start": 315, "end": 324, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6954}, {"surface": "the", "start": 338, "end": 341, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8136}, {"surface": "density parameter,", "start": 342, "end": 360, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8941}, {"surface": "Ωdyn~0.2,", "start": 361, "end": 370, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8127}, {"surface": "spatial curvature", "start": 380, "end": 397, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3809}, {"surface": "scalar-field potential", "start": 412, "end": 434, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8847}, {"surface": "the", "start": 495, "end": 498, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.603}, {"surface": "scalar field", "start": 499, "end": 511, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6808}, {"surface": "the", "start": 545, "end": 548, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7027}, {"surface": "field equations", "start": 549, "end": 564, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8755}, {"surface": "gravitation theory", "start": 687, "end": 705, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.922}, {"surface": "Eötvös-Dicke", "start": 711, "end": 723, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8999}, {"surface": "the", "start": 772, "end": 775, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9612}, {"surface": "scalar field", "start": 776, "end": 788, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7859}, {"surface": "light (", "start": 792, "end": 799, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9235}, {"surface": "nongravitational) fields", "start": 799, "end": 823, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5297}, {"surface": "Nucleosynthesis", "start": 825, "end": 840, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8843}, {"surface": "hot big-bang", "start": 869, "end": 881, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8471}, {"surface": "linear", "start": 892, "end": 898, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6782}, {"surface": "baryonic perturbations,", "start": 935, "end": 958, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9832}, {"surface": "baryon-dominated", "start": 966, "end": 982, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9448}, {"surface": "canonical", "start": 1027, "end": 1036, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4944}, {"surface": "homogeneous scalar-field energy density", "start": 1093, "end": 1132, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.945}, {"surface": "low", "start": 1136, "end": 1139, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5239}, {"surface": "red-shifts", "start": 1140, "end": 1150, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4824}, {"surface": "perturbations", "start": 1174, "end": 1187, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7462}, {"surface": "baryonic fluid", "start": 1195, "end": 1209, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8837}, {"surface": "the", "start": 1233, "end": 1236, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8716}, {"surface": "scalar field", "start": 1237, "end": 1249, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8561}, {"surface": "nonrelativistic gravitational fields", "start": 1282, "end": 1318, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9258}, {"surface": "radiation-dominated", "start": 1334, "end": 1353, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7846}, {"surface": "matter-dominated", "start": 1355, "end": 1371, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7944}, {"surface": "scalar-field-dominated", "start": 1376, "end": 1398, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9147}, {"surface": "dynamical estimates", "start": 1487, "end": 1506, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.396}, {"surface": "the", "start": 1510, "end": 1513, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.837}, {"surface": "mean mass density", "start": 1514, "end": 1531, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.834}, {"surface": "spatial curvature", "start": 1558, "end": 1575, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5671}]}
{"bibcode": "2021A&A...649A...1G", "title": "Gaia Early Data Release 3. Summary of the contents and survey properties", "abstract_clean": "Context. We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. Results: Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (GBP − GRP) colour are also available. The passbands for G, GBP, and GRP are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Conclusions: Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30-40% for the parallaxes and by a factor ~2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, GBP, and GRP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1% level", "domain_category": "astronomy", "spans": [{"surface": "Gaia data",

{"bibcode": "2014ARA&A..52..415M", "title": "Cosmic Star-Formation History", "abstract_clean": "Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ∼1% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.", "domain_category": "astronomy", "spans": [{"surface": "galaxy formation", "start": 138, "end": 154, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9719}, {"surface": "astronomers", "start": 256, "end": 267, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7856}, {"surface": "cosmic history", "start": 279, "end": 293, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5271}, {"surface": "star formation, heavy element production,", "start": 297, "end": 338, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9786}, {"surface": "reionization of the Universe", "start": 343, "end": 371, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5903}, {"surface": "cosmic “dark ages”", "start": 381, "end": 399, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4903}, {"surface": "the", "start": 464, "end": 467, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6094}, {"surface": "star-formation rate density", "start": 468, "end": 495, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9245}, {"surface": "Big Bang", "start": 535, "end": 543, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6848}, {"surface": "e-folding", "start": 606, "end": 615, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5646}, {"surface": "stellar mass observed today", "start": 650, "end": 677, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7114}, {"surface": "the", "start": 752, "end": 755, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4269}, {"surface": "cosmic star-formation rate density", "start": 756, "end": 790, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7131}, {"surface": "today's stars formed", "start": 847, "end": 867, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9524}, {"surface": "reionization", "start": 888, "end": 900, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8718}, {"surface": "initial mass function", "start": 938, "end": 959, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7281}, {"surface": "global stellar mass density", "start": 965, "end": 992, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8673}, {"surface": "time", "start": 1043, "end": 1047, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4603}, {"surface": "star-formation activity", "start": 1078, "end": 1101, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.619}, {"surface": "comoving rates", "start": 1107, "end": 1121, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8284}, {"surface": "star formation", "start": 1125, "end": 1139, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9823}, {"surface": "central black hole accretion", "start": 1144, "end": 1172, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9888}, {"surface": "coevolution of", "start": 1227, "end": 1241, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.968}, {"surface": "black holes", "start": 1242, "end": 1253, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9883}, {"surface": "the", "start": 1291, "end": 1294, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8743}, {"surface": "mean metallicity of", "start": 1295, "end": 1314, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9526}, {"surface": "the Universe", "start": 1315, "end": 1327, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7259}, {"surface": "about 0.001 solar", "start": 1331, "end": 1348, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3983}, {"surface": "Big Bang", "start": 1377, "end": 1385, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6186}, {"surface": "hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons", "start": 1456, "end": 1488, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9573}, {"surface": "cosmological", "start": 1527, "end": 1539, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9736}, {"surface": "reionization", "start": 1540, "end": 1552, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6337}]}

These objects, discovered during the course of the GOODS ACS Treasury program, include 6 of the 7 highest redshift SNe Ia known, all at z>1.25, and populate the Hubble diagram in unexplored territory. The luminosity distances to these objects and to 170 previously reported SNe Ia have been determined using empirical relations between light-curve shape and luminosity. A purely kinematic interpretation of the SN Ia sample provides evidence at the greater than 99% confidence level for a transition from deceleration to acceleration or, similarly, strong evidence for a cosmic jerk. Using a simple model of the expansion history, the transition between the two epochs is constrained to be at z=0.46+/-0.13. The data are consistent with the cosmic concordance model of ΩM~0.3,ΩΛ~0.7 (χ2dof=1.06) and are inconsistent with a simple model of evolution or dust as an alternative to dark energy. For a flat universe with a cosmological constant, we measure ΩM=0.29+/-0.050.03 (equivalently, ΩΛ=0.71). When combined with external flat-universe constraints, including the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure, we find w=-1.02+/-0.130.19 (and w<-0.76 at the 95% confidence level) for an assumed static equation of state of dark energy, P=wρc2. Joint constraints on both the recent equation of state of dark energy, w0, and its time evolution, dw/dz, are a factor of ~8 more precise than the first estimates and twice as precise as those without the SNe Ia discovered with HST. Our constraints are consistent with the static nature of and value of w expected for a cosmological constant (i.e., w0=-1.0, dw/dz=0) and are inconsistent with very rapid evolution of dark energy. We address consequences of evolving dark energy for the fate of the universe.

The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass [Formula: see text] and the velocity dispersion σ of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from [Formula: see text] in brightest cluster ellipticals to [Formula: see text] in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105-106M⊙ are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any [Formula: see text] correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution. The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with [Formula: see text] suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between [Formula: see text] and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in [Formula: see text] correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.", "domain_category": "astronomy", "spans": [{"surface": "85

{"bibcode": "1977ApJ...217..425M", "title": "The size distribution of interstellar grains.", "abstract_clean": "The observed interstellar extinction over the wavelength range 0.11 μm < λ < 1 μm was fitted with a very general particle size distribution of uncoated graphite, enstatite, olivine, silicon carbide, iron, and magnetite. Combinations of these materials, up to three at a time, were considered. The cosmic abundances ofthe various constituents were taken into account as constraints on the possible distributions of particle sizes. Excellent fits to the interstellar extinction, including the narrowness of the λ2160 feature, proved possible. Graphite was a necessary component of any good mixture, but it could be used with any of the other materials. The particle size distributions are roughly power law in nature, with an exponent of about -3.3 to -3.6. The size range for graphite is about 0.005 μm to about 1 μm. The size distribution for the other materials is also approximately power law in nature, with the same exponent, but there is a narrower range of sizes: about 0.025-0.25 μm, depending on the material. The number of large particles is not well determined, because they are gray. Similarly, the number of small particles is not well determined because they are in the Rayleigh limit. This power-law distribution is drastically different from an Oort-van de Hulst distribution, which is much more slowly varying for small particles but drops much faster for particles larger than average. The extinction was also fitted with spherical graphite particles plus cylinders of each of the other materials. Linear and circular polarizations were then determined for the cylinders on the assumption of Davis-Greenstein alignment. The extinction was quite satisfactory, but the linear polarization reached a maximum in the ultraviolet (about 1600 Å). This is because the mixture contains many small particles. Ifthe small particles are not elongated or aligned, the wavelength dependence of the polarization can be fitted, but the larger particles which are aligned do not provide enough polarization per magnitude of extinction. However, a fit to polarization and extinction can be achieved if the material responsible for the polarization contributes only a small part of the extinction but consists of fairly large particles and is very well aligned. Dielectric particles with coatings could also provide the polarization.

Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system.

{"bibcode": "2013JGRD..118.5380B", "title": "Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: A scientific assessment", "abstract_clean": "carbon aerosol plays a unique and important role in Earth's climate system. Black carbon is a type of carbonaceous material with a unique combination of physical properties. This assessment provides an evaluation of black-carbon climate forcing that is comprehensive in its inclusion of all known and relevant processes and that is quantitative in providing best estimates and uncertainties of the main forcing terms: direct solar absorption; influence on liquid, mixed phase, and ice clouds; and deposition on snow and ice. These effects are calculated with climate models, but when possible, they are evaluated with both microphysical measurements and field observations. Predominant sources are combustion related, namely, fossil fuels for transportation, solid fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open burning of biomass. Total global emissions of black carbon using bottom-up inventory methods are 7500 Gg yr-1 in the year 2000 with an uncertainty range of 2000 to 29000. However, global atmospheric absorption attributable to black carbon is too low in many models and should be increased by a factor of almost 3. After this scaling, the best estimate for the industrial-era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is +0.71 W m-2 with 90% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W m-2. Total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W m-2. Direct radiative forcing alone does not capture important rapid adjustment mechanisms. A framework is described and used for quantifying climate forcings, including rapid adjustments. The best estimate of industrial-era climate forcing of black carbon through all forcing mechanisms, including clouds and cryosphere forcing, is +1.1 W m-2 with 90% uncertainty bounds of +0.17 to +2.1 W m-2. Thus, there is a very high probability that black carbon emissions, independent of co-emitted species, have a positive forcing and warm the climate. We estimate that black carbon, with a total climate forcing of +1.1 W m-2, is the second most important human emission in terms of its climate forcing in the present-day atmosphere; only carbon dioxide is estimated to have a greater forcing. Sources that emit black carbon also emit other short-lived species that may either cool or warm climate. Climate forcings from co-emitted species are estimated and used in the framework described herein. When the principal effects of short-lived co-emissions, including cooling agents such as sulfur dioxide, are included in net forcing, energy-related sources (fossil fuel and biofuel) have an industrial-era climate forcing of +0.22 (-0.50 to +1.08) W m-2 during the first year after emission. For a few of these sources, such as diesel engines and possibly residential biofuels, warming is strong enough that eliminating all short-lived emissions from these sources would reduce net climate forcing (i.e., produce cooling). When open burning emissions, which emit high levels of organic matter, are included in the total, the best estimate of net industrial-era climate forcing by all short-lived species from black-carbon-rich sources becomes slightly negative (-0.06 W m-2 with 90% uncertainty bounds of -1.45 to +1.29 W m-2). The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black-carbon-rich sources are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both black carbon and co-emitted organic carbon. In prioritizing potential black-carbon mitigation actions, non-science factors, such as technical feasibility, costs, policy design, and implementation feasibility play important roles. The major sources of black carbon are presently in different stages with regard to the feasibility for near-term mitigation. This assessment, by evaluating the large number and complexity of the associated physical and radiative processes in black-carbon climate forcing, sets a baseline from which to improve future climate

GLDAS is unique in that it is an uncoupled land surface modeling system that drives multiple models, integrates a huge quantity of observation-based data, runs globally at high resolution (0.25°), and produces results in near real time (typically within 48 h of the present). GLDAS is also a test bed for innovative modeling and assimilation capabilities. A vegetation-based “tiling” approach is used to simulate subgrid-scale variability, with a 1-km global vegetation dataset as its basis. Soil and elevation parameters are based on high-resolution global datasets. Observation-based precipitation and downward radiation and output fields from the best available global coupled atmospheric data assimilation systems are employed as forcing data. The high-quality, global land surface fields provided by GLDAS will be used to initialize weather and climate prediction models and will promote various hydrometeorological studies and applications.

{"bibcode": "1996RSEnv..58..257G", "title": "NDWI-A normalized difference water index for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space", "abstract_clean": "The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 μm and a near-IR channel around 0.86 μm. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as (ϱ(0.86 μm) - ϱ(1.24 μ m))/(ϱ(0.86 μ m) + ϱ(1.24 μ m)), where ϱ represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-μm and the 1.24-μm channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 μm is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 μm is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86-1.24 μm region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-μm channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 μm, NDWI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance spectra of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI.

{"bibcode": "1995GeCoA..59.1217W", "title": "The composition of the continental crust", "abstract_clean": "A new calculation of the crustal composition is based on the proportions of upper crust (UC) to felsic lower crust (FLC) to mafic lower crust (MLC) of about 1:0.6:0.4. These proportions are derived from a 3000 km long refraction seismic profile through western Europe (EGT) comprising 60% old shield and 40% younger fold belt area with about 40 km average Moho depth. A granodioritic bulk composition of the UC in major elements and thirty-two minor and trace elements was calculated from the Canadian Shield data (Shaw et al., 1967, 1976). The computed abundance of thirty-three additional trace elements in the UC is based on the following proportions of major rock units derived from mapping: 14% sedimentary rocks, 25% granites, 20% granodiorites, 5% tonalites, 6% gabbros, and 30% gneisses and mica schists. The composition of FLC and MLC in major and thirty-six minor and trace elements is calculated from data on felsic granulite terrains and mafic xenoliths, respectively, compiled by Rudnick and Presper (1990). More than thirty additional trace element abundances in FLC and MLC were computed or estimated from literature data. The bulk continental crust has a tonalitic and not a dioritic composition with distinctly higher concentrations of incompatible elements including the heat producing isotopes in our calculation. A dioritic bulk crust was suggested by Taylor and McLennan (1985). The amount of tonalite in the crust requires partial melting of mafic rocks with about 100 km thickness (compared with about 7 km in the present MLC) and water supply from dehydrated slabs and mafic intrusions. At the relatively low temperatures of old crustal segments MLC was partly converted into eclogite which could be recycled into the upper mantle under favourable tectonic conditions. The chemical fractionation of UC against FLC + MLC was caused by granitoidal partial melts and by mantle degassing which has controlled weathering and accumulation of volatile compounds close to the

Here, we present a diagnostically interesting decomposition of NSE (and hence MSE), which facilitates analysis of the relative importance of its different components in the context of hydrological modelling, and show how model calibration problems can arise due to interactions among these components. The analysis is illustrated by calibrating a simple conceptual precipitation-runoff model to daily data for a number of Austrian basins having a broad range of hydro-meteorological characteristics. Evaluation of the results clearly demonstrates the problems that can be associated with any calibration based on the NSE (or MSE) criterion. While we propose and test an alternative criterion that can help to reduce model calibration problems, the primary purpose of this study is not to present an improved measure of model performance. Instead, we seek to show that there are systematic problems inherent with any optimization based on formulations related to the MSE. The analysis and results have implications to the manner in which we calibrate and evaluate environmental models; we discuss these and suggest possible ways forward that may move us towards an improved and diagnostically meaningful approach to model performance evaluation and identification.", "domain_category": "earth_science", "spans": [{"surface": "The mean squared error", "start": 7, "end": 29, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.745}, {"surface": "NSE)", "start": 98, "end": 102, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.546}, {"surface": "hydrological models", "start": 176, "end": 195, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8858}, {"surface": "observed", "start": 201, "end": 209, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5152}, {"surface": "NSE (", "start": 279, "end": 284, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9308}, {"surface": "MSE)", "start": 294, "end": 298, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5912}, {"surface": "hydrological modelling", "start": 400, "end": 422, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4959}, {"surface": "conceptual precipitation-runoff model", "start": 570, "end": 607, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4489}, {"surface": "daily data", "start": 611, "end": 621, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8966}, {"surface": "Austrian basins", "start": 638, "end": 653, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.8747}, {"surface": "hydro-meteorological characteristics", "start": 678, "end": 714, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7351}, {"surface": "NSE (", "start": 833, "end": 838, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.787}, {"surface": "MSE)", "start": 841, "end": 845, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5058}, {"surface": "MSE", "start": 1182, "end": 1185, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5586}, {"surface": "environmental models", "start": 1279, "end": 1299, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9037}, {"surface": "model", "start": 1431, "end": 1436, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5114}]}
{"bibcode": "2005EcoM...75....3H", "title": "Effects of Biodiversity on Ecosystem Functioning: a Consensus of Current Knowledge", "abstract_clean": "Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.", "domain_category": "earth_science", "spans": [{"surface": "biological communities", "start": 39, "end": 61, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5789}, {"surface": "species invasions", "start": 117, "end": 134, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7112}, {"surface": "species extinctions", "start": 139, "end": 158, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5336}, {"surface": "the Earth's biodiversity", "start": 228, "end": 252, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3469}, {"surface": "ethical", "start": 271, "end": 278, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6715}, {"surface": "aesthetic reasons", "start": 283, "end": 300, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3314}, {"surface": "ecosystem properties", "start": 349, "end": 369, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5101}, {"surface": "humanity", "start": 413, "end": 421, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4028}, {"surface": "ecosystem properties", "start": 500, "end": 520, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6447}, {"surface": "biodiversity", "start": 539, "end": 551, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8117}, {"surface": "functional", "start": 568, "end": 578, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3851}, {"surface": "Species effects", "start": 708, "end": 723, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7927}, {"surface": "climate", "start": 759, "end": 766, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7315}, {"surface": "resource availability", "start": 768, "end": 789, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.383}, {"surface": "disturbance regimes", "start": 795, "end": 814, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4741}, {"surface": "biodiversity", "start": 1061, "end": 1073, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7813}, {"surface": "ecosystem functioning", "start": 1078, "end": 1099, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4301}, {"surface": "biotic", "start": 1222, "end": 1228, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5865}, {"surface": "abiotic controls", "start": 1233, "end": 1249, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5282}, {"surface": "ecosystem properties", "start": 1253, "end": 1273, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6343}, {"surface": "ecological communities", "start": 1279, "end": 1301, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.813}, {"surface": "species extinctions", "start": 1341, "end": 1360, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.811}, {"surface": "policy", "start": 1399, "end": 1405, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.523}, {"surface": "social", "start": 1499, "end": 1505, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4155}, {"surface": "potential management practices", "start": 1534, "end": 1564, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7431}, {"surface": "current losses", "start": 1635, "end": 1649, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7309}, {"surface": "Earth's ecosystems", "start": 1705, "end": 1723, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7248}, {"surface": "Species'", "start": 1858, "end": 1866, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.472}, {"surface": "functional", "start": 1867, "end": 1877, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3772}, {"surface": "Functional characteristics", "start": 1935, "end": 1961, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5618}, {"surface": "dominant species", "start": 2017, "end": 2033, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8239}, {"surface": "keystone species", "start": 2035, "end": 2051, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5857}, {"surface": "ecological engineers", "start": 2053, "end": 2073, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7437}, {"surface": "competition", "start": 2113, "end": 2124, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5587}, {"surface": "facilitation", "start": 2126, "end": 2138, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4237}, {"surface": "mutualism", "start": 2140, "end": 2149, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6485}, {"surface": "disease", "start": 2151, "end": 2158, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.708}, {"surface": "predation", "start": 2164, "end": 2173, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5432}, {"surface": "Relative abundance", "start": 2176, "end": 2194, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7864}, {"surface": "a", "start": 2319, "end": 2320, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4432}, {"surface": "keystone predator)", "start": 2321, "end": 2339, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.567}, {"surface": "material flows", "start": 2386, "end": 2400, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3911}, {"surface": "biota", "start": 2419, "end": 2424, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6216}, {"surface": "species invasions", "start": 2443, "end": 2460, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6701}, {"surface": "species loss", "start": 2704, "end": 2716, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.748}, {"surface": "composition", "start": 2731, "end": 2742, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4297}, {"surface": "potential", "start": 2877, "end": 2886, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5356}, {"surface": "species loss", "start": 2963, "end": 2975, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5824}]}

It constrains plant transpiration and photosynthesis in several regions of the world, with consequent impacts on the water, energy and biogeochemical cycles. Moreover it is a storage component for precipitation and radiation anomalies, inducing persistence in the climate system. Finally, it is involved in a number of feedbacks at the local, regional and global scales, and plays a major role in climate-change projections. In this review, we provide a synthesis of past research on the role of soil moisture for the climate system, based both on modelling and observational studies. We focus on soil moisture-temperature and soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks, and their possible modifications with climate change. We also highlight further impacts of soil moisture on climate, and the state of research regarding the validation of the relevant processes. There are promises for major advances in this research field in coming years thanks to the development of new validation datasets and multi-model initiatives. However, the availability of ground observations continues to be critical in limiting progress and should therefore strongly be fostered at the international level. Exchanges across disciplines will also be essential for bridging current knowledge gaps in this field. This is of key importance given the manifold impacts of soil moisture on climate, and their relevance for climate-change projections.

{"bibcode": "2008JGRD..11313103I", "title": "Radiative forcing by long-lived greenhouse gases: Calculations with the AER radiative transfer models", "abstract_clean": "A primary component of the observed recent climate change is the radiative forcing from increased concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs). Effective simulation of anthropogenic climate change by general circulation models (GCMs) is strongly dependent on the accurate representation of radiative processes associated with water vapor, ozone, and LLGHGs. In the context of the increasing application of the Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc. (AER), radiation models within the GCM community, their capability to calculate longwave and shortwave radiative forcing for clear sky scenarios previously examined by the radiative transfer model intercomparison project (RTMIP) is presented. Forcing calculations with the AER line-by-line (LBL) models are very consistent with the RTMIP line-by-line results in the longwave and shortwave. The AER broadband models, in all but one case, calculate longwave forcings within a range of -0.20 to 0.23 W m-2 of LBL calculations and shortwave forcings within a range of -0.16 to 0.38 W m-2 of LBL results.

The weekly product has been available since 1993 and is widely used for weather and climate monitoring and forecasting. Errors in the satellite bias correction and the sea ice to SST conversion algorithm are discussed, and then an improved version of the OI analysis is developed. The changes result in a modest reduction in the satellite bias that leaves small global residual biases of roughly 0.03°C. The major improvement in the analysis occurs at high latitudes due to the new sea ice algorithm where local differences between the old and new analysis can exceed 1°C. Comparisons with other SST products are needed to determine the consistency of the OI. These comparisons show that the differences among products occur on large time- and space scales with monthly rms differences exceeding 0.5°C in some regions. These regions are primarily the mid- and high-latitude Southern Oceans and the Arctic where data are sparse, as well as high-gradient areas such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio where the gradients cannot be properly resolved on a 1° grid. In addition, globally averaged differences of roughly 0.05°C occur among the products on decadal scales. These differences primarily arise from the same regions where the rms differences are large.

Due to mathematical feedback between the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations and, similarly, between the barotropic momentum and continuity equations, it is advantageous to treat both modes so that, after a time step for the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and vice versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step simultaneously. This leads to a new family of time-stepping algorithms that combine forward-backward feedback with the best known synchronous algorithms, allowing an increased time step due to the enhanced internal stability without sacrificing its accuracy. Based on these algorithms we design a split-explicit hydrodynamic kernel for a realistic oceanic model, which addresses multiple numerical issues associated with mode splitting. This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of the barotropic mode via a specially designed filter function to guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers and yields more accurate (up to second-order), resolved barotropic processes, while preventing aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals into the slow baroclinic motions. It has a more accurate mode-splitting due to redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for the local variations in density field, while maintaining the computational efficiency of a split model. It is naturally compatible with a variety of centered and upstream-biased high-order advection algorithms, and helps to mitigate computational cost of expensive physical parameterization of mixing processes and submodels.", "domain_category": "earth_science", "spans": [{"surface": "time-stepping", "start": 87, "end": 100, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9532}, {"surface": "mode-splitting", "start": 105, "end": 119, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9592}, {"surface": "terrain-following coordinate oceanic", "start": 166, "end": 202, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4949}, {"surface": "mathematical", "start": 217, "end": 229, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4681}, {"surface": "the", "start": 247, "end": 250, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7828}, {"surface": "baroclinic momentum", "start": 251, "end": 270, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9625}, {"surface": "tracer equations", "start": 275, "end": 291, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8618}, {"surface": "the", "start": 316, "end": 319, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6073}, {"surface": "barotropic momentum", "start": 320, "end": 339, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.941}, {"surface": "continuity equations", "start": 344, "end": 364, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8555}, {"surface": "momentum equation", "start": 440, "end": 457, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8544}, {"surface": "tracers and", "start": 529, "end": 540, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9138}, {"surface": "continuity,", "start": 541, "end": 552, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5099}, {"surface": "time-stepping", "start": 669, "end": 682, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9061}, {"surface": "forward", "start": 707, "end": 714, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7747}, {"surface": "synchronous", "start": 753, "end": 764, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6163}, {"surface": "internal stability", "start": 829, "end": 847, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8705}, {"surface": "split", "start": 920, "end": 925, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9186}, {"surface": "hydrodynamic", "start": 935, "end": 947, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6667}, {"surface": "realistic oceanic", "start": 961, "end": 978, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5794}, {"surface": "mode splitting", "start": 1044, "end": 1058, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9378}, {"surface": "consistent", "start": 1081, "end": 1091, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6425}, {"surface": "the", "start": 1114, "end": 1117, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9026}, {"surface": "barotropic mode", "start": 1118, "end": 1133, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9696}, {"surface": "exact conservation", "start": 1193, "end": 1211, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8185}, {"surface": "constancy preservation properties", "start": 1216, "end": 1249, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8506}, {"surface": "tracers", "start": 1254, "end": 1261, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.872}, {"surface": "second", "start": 1294, "end": 1300, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4431}, {"surface": "barotropic processes", "start": 1318, "end": 1338, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7084}, {"surface": "unresolved", "start": 1369, "end": 1379, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9622}, {"surface": "barotropic signals", "start": 1380, "end": 1398, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8328}, {"surface": "slow baroclinic motions", "start": 1408, "end": 1431, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7861}, {"surface": "mode-splitting", "start": 1456, "end": 1470, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.82}, {"surface": "barotropic pressure-gradient terms", "start": 1488, "end": 1522, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9169}, {"surface": "density field", "start": 1562, "end": 1575, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9628}, {"surface": "split", "start": 1629, "end": 1634, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6506}, {"surface": "centered", "start": 1687, "end": 1695, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6812}, {"surface": "upstream", "start": 1700, "end": 1708, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8284}, {"surface": "high-order advection", "start": 1716, "end": 1736, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.847}, {"surface": "mixing processes", "start": 1832, "end": 1848, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9395}]}

In particular, there is considerable east-west asymmetry which can be illustrated by solutions for heating concentrated in an area of finite extent. This is of more than academic interest because heating in practice tends to be concentrated in specific areas. For instance, a model with heating symmetric about the equator at Indonesian longitudes produces low-level easterly flow over the Pacific through propagation of Kelvin waves into the region. It also produces low-level westerly inflow over the Indian Ocean (but in a smaller region) because planetary waves propagate there. In the heating region itself the low-level flow is away from the equator as required by the vorticity equation. The return flow toward the equator is farther west because of planetary wave propagation, and so cyclonic flow is obtained around lows which form on the western margins of the heating zone.

Although calibration curves are constructed from independently dated archives, they invariably require revision as new data become available and our understanding of the Earth system improves. In this volume the international14C calibration curves for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as well as for the ocean surface layer, have been updated to include a wealth of new data and extended to 55,000 cal BP. Based on tree rings, IntCal20 now extends as a fully atmospheric record to ca. 13,900 cal BP. For the older part of the timescale, IntCal20 comprises statistically integrated evidence from floating tree-ring chronologies, lacustrine and marine sediments, speleothems, and corals. We utilized improved evaluation of the timescales and location variable14C offsets from the atmosphere (reservoir age, dead carbon fraction) for each dataset. New statistical methods have refined the structure of the calibration curves while maintaining a robust treatment of uncertainties in the14C ages, the calendar ages and other corrections. The inclusion of modeled marine reservoir ages derived from a three-dimensional ocean circulation model has allowed us to apply more appropriate reservoir corrections to the marine14C data rather than the previous use of constant regional offsets from the atmosphere. Here we provide an overview of the new and revised datasets and the associated methods used for the construction of the IntCal20 curve and explore potential regional offsets for tree-ring data. We discuss the main differences with respect to the previous calibration curve, IntCal13, and some of the implications for archaeology and geosciences ranging from the recent past to the time of the extinction of the Neanderthals.", "domain_category": "earth_science", "spans": [{"surface": "Radiocarbon (14C) ages", "start": 0, "end": 22, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9781}, {"surface": "absolutely dated chronologies", "start": 38, "end": 67, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9286}, {"surface": "archaeological", "start": 72, "end": 86, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.84}, {"surface": "calendar age equivalents", "start": 151, "end": 175, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9639}, {"surface": "atmospheric14C concentration", "start": 235, "end": 263, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9863}, {"surface": "calibration curves", "start": 274, "end": 292, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7714}, {"surface": "the", "start": 431, "end": 434, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5721}, {"surface": "Earth system", "start": 435, "end": 447, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6523}, {"surface": "international14C calibration curves", "start": 477, "end": 512, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9812}, {"surface": "Northern", "start": 526, "end": 534, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4611}, {"surface": "Southern Hemispheres,", "start": 539, "end": 560, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.2723}, {"surface": "ocean surface layer,", "start": 580, "end": 600, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5273}, {"surface": "new data", "start": 642, "end": 650, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6771}, {"surface": "tree rings", "start": 691, "end": 701, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8896}, {"surface": "IntCal20", "start": 703, "end": 711, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9197}, {"surface": "fully atmospheric record", "start": 729, "end": 753, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6562}, {"surface": "IntCal20", "start": 813, "end": 821, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.901}, {"surface": "statistically integrated evidence", "start": 832, "end": 865, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6236}, {"surface": "floating tree-ring chronologies", "start": 871, "end": 902, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8828}, {"surface": "lacustrine and marine sediments", "start": 904, "end": 935, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8705}, {"surface": "speleothems,", "start": 937, "end": 949, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9065}, {"surface": "corals", "start": 954, "end": 960, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4804}, {"surface": "the", "start": 997, "end": 1000, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7005}, {"surface": "timescales", "start": 1001, "end": 1011, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5802}, {"surface": "location variable", "start": 1016, "end": 1033, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7815}, {"surface": "14C offsets from", "start": 1033, "end": 1049, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6008}, {"surface": "the", "start": 1050, "end": 1053, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4123}, {"surface": "atmosphere (", "start": 1054, "end": 1066, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5686}, {"surface": "reservoir age,", "start": 1066, "end": 1080, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8513}, {"surface": "dead carbon fraction)", "start": 1081, "end": 1102, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.887}, {"surface": "calibration", "start": 1179, "end": 1190, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5201}, {"surface": "the", "start": 1255, "end": 1258, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.986}, {"surface": "14C ages", "start": 1258, "end": 1266, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6408}, {"surface": "the calendar ages", "start": 1268, "end": 1285, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8541}, {"surface": "modeled", "start": 1326, "end": 1333, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9374}, {"surface": "marine reservoir ages", "start": 1334, "end": 1355, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8893}, {"surface": "ocean circulation", "start": 1389, "end": 1406, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5938}, {"surface": "reservoir corrections", "start": 1454, "end": 1475, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8847}, {"surface": "marine14C data", "start": 1483, "end": 1497, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9537}, {"surface": "constant regional offsets from", "start": 1530, "end": 1560, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9658}, {"surface": "atmosphere", "start": 1565, "end": 1575, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4549}, {"surface": "IntCal20", "start": 1697, "end": 1705, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9626}, {"surface": "regional", "start": 1734, "end": 1742, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7398}, {"surface": "tree-ring data", "start": 1755, "end": 1769, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8933}, {"surface": "calibration curve", "start": 1832, "end": 1849, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4523}, {"surface": "IntCal13", "start": 1851, "end": 1859, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9115}, {"surface": "archaeology", "start": 1894, "end": 1905, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9269}, {"surface": "the extinction of", "start": 1966, "end": 1983, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3784}]}

Observations, theories, and models of oceanic vertical mixing are surveyed. Two distinct regimes are identified: ocean mixing in the boundary layer near the surface under a variety of surface forcing conditions (stabilizing, destabilizing, and wind driven), and mixing in the ocean interior due to internal waves, shear instability, and double diffusion (arising from the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt). Mixing schemes commonly applied to the upper ocean are shown not to contain some potentially important boundary layer physics. Therefore a new parameterization of oceanic boundary layer mixing is developed to accommodate some of this physics. It includes a scheme for determining the boundary layer depth h, where the turbulent contribution to the vertical shear of a bulk Richardson number is parameterized. Expressions for diffusivity and nonlocal transport throughout the boundary layer are given. The diffusivity is formulated to agree with similarity theory of turbulence in the surface layer and is subject to the conditions that both it and its vertical gradient match the interior values at h. This nonlocal \"K profile parameterization\" (KPP) is then verified and compared to alternatives, including its atmospheric counterparts. Its most important feature is shown to be the capability of the boundary layer to penetrate well into a stable thermocline in both convective and wind-driven situations. The diffusivities of the aforementioned three interior mixing processes are modeled as constants, functions of a gradient Richardson number (a measure of the relative importance of stratification to destabilizing shear), and functions of the double-diffusion density ratio, Rρ. Oceanic simulations of convective penetration, wind deepening, and diurnal cycling are used to determine appropriate values for various model parameters as weak functions of vertical resolution. Annual cycle simulations at ocean weather station Papa for 1961 and 1969-1974 are used to test the complete suite of parameterizations. Model and observed temperatures at all depths are shown to agree very well into September, after which systematic advective cooling in the ocean produces expected differences. It is argued that this cooling and a steady salt advection into the model are needed to balance the net annual surface heating and freshwater input. With these advections, good multiyear simulations of temperature and salinity can be achieved. These results and KPP simulations of the diurnal cycle at the Long-Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) site are compared with the results of other models. It is demonstrated that the KPP model exchanges properties between the mixed layer and thermocline in a manner consistent with observations, and at least as well or better than alternatives.",

The relevant distribution coefficients for common POPs are several orders of magnitude in favour of the plastic medium. Consequently, the microparticles laden with high levels of POPs can be ingested by marine biota. Bioavailability and the efficiency of transfer of the ingested POPs across trophic levels are not known and the potential damage posed by these to the marine ecosystem has yet to be quantified and modelled.

{"bibcode": "1980QJRMS.106...85W", "title": "Correction of flux measurements for density effects due to heat and water vapour transfer", "abstract_clean": "When the atmospheric turbulent flux of a minor constituent such as CO2 (or of water vapour as a special case) is measured by either the eddy covariance or the mean gradient technique, account may need to be taken of variations of the constituent's density due to the presence of a flux of heat and/or water vapour. In this paper the basic relationships are discussed in the context of vertical transfer in the lower atmosphere, and the required corrections to the measured flux are derived. If the measurement involves sensing of the fluctuations or mean gradient of the constituent's mixing ratio relative to the dry air component, then no correction is required; while with sensing of the constituent's specific mass content relative to the total moist air, a correction arising from the water vapour flux only is required. Correspondingly, if in mean gradient measurements the constituent's density is measured in air from different heights which has been pre-dried and brought to a common temperature, then again no correction is required; while if the original (moist) air itself is brought to a common temperature, then only a correction arising from the water vapour flux is required. If the constituent's density fluctuations or mean gradients are measured directly in the air in situ, then corrections arising from both heat and water vapour fluxes are required.

Little attention has been paid to the influence of variability in wind speed on the calculated gas transfer velocities and the possibility of chemical enhancement of CO2 exchange at low wind speeds over the ocean. The effect of these parameters is illustrated using a quadratic dependence of gas exchange on wind speed which is fit through gas transfer velocities over the ocean determined by the natural-14C disequilibrium and the bomb-14C inventory methods. Some of the variability between different data sets can be accounted for by the suggested mechanisms, but much of the variation appears due to other causes. Possible causes for the large difference between two frequently used relationships between gas transfer and wind speed are discussed.

Examinations showed no discontinuity during the 17-yr period, despite the different data sources used for the different subperiods. Comparisons of the CMAP with the merged analysis of Huffman et al. revealed remarkable agreements over the global land areas and over tropical and subtropical oceanic areas, with differences observed over extratropical oceanic areas. The 17-yr CMAP dataset is used to investigate the annual and interannual variability in large-scale precipitation. The mean distribution and the annual cycle in the 17-yr dataset exhibit reasonable agreement with existing long-term means except over the eastern tropical Pacific. The interannual variability associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon resembles that found in previous studies, but with substantial additional details, particularly over the oceans.

In China, particulate pollution is a serious environmental problem that is influencing air quality, regional and global climates, and human health. In response to the extremely severe and persistent haze pollution experienced by about 800 million people during the first quarter of 2013 (refs 4, 5), the Chinese State Council announced its aim to reduce concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) by up to 25 per cent relative to 2012 levels by 2017 (ref. 6). Such efforts however require elucidation of the factors governing the abundance and composition of PM2.5, which remain poorly constrained in China. Here we combine a comprehensive set of novel and state-of-the-art offline analytical approaches and statistical techniques to investigate the chemical nature and sources of particulate matter at urban locations in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xi'an during January 2013. We find that the severe haze pollution event was driven to a large extent by secondary aerosol formation, which contributed 30-77 per cent and 44-71 per cent (average for all four cities) of PM2.5 and of organic aerosol, respectively. On average, the contribution of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) are found to be of similar importance (SOA/SIA ratios range from 0.6 to 1.4). Our results suggest that, in addition to mitigating primary particulate emissions, reducing the emissions of secondary aerosol precursors from, for example, fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning is likely to be important for controlling China's PM2.5 levels and for reducing the environmental, economic and health impacts resulting from particulate pollution.", "domain_category": "earth_science", "spans": [{"surface": "air pollution", "start": 91, "end": 104, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5855}, {"surface": "particulate pollution", "start": 200, "end": 221, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8385}, {"surface": "air quality", "start": 277, "end": 288, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6695}, {"surface": "persistent haze pollution", "start": 378, "end": 403, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4945}, {"surface": "PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometres)", "start": 562, "end": 643, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8302}, {"surface": "2012 levels", "start": 677, "end": 688, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4542}, {"surface": "PM2.5,", "start": 806, "end": 812, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8687}, {"surface": "particulate matter", "start": 1028, "end": 1046, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9275}, {"surface": "Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xi'an", "start": 1069, "end": 1107, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.702}, {"surface": "severe haze pollution event", "start": 1146, "end": 1173, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8874}, {"surface": "secondary aerosol formation", "start": 1206, "end": 1233, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7707}, {"surface": "PM2.5", "start": 1320, "end": 1325, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5257}, {"surface": "of organic aerosol,", "start": 1330, "end": 1349, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6324}, {"surface": "secondary organic aerosol (SOA", "start": 1396, "end": 1426, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7228}, {"surface": "secondary inorganic aerosol (", "start": 1432, "end": 1461, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7964}, {"surface": "SIA)", "start": 1461, "end": 1465, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4132}, {"surface": "SIA", "start": 1509, "end": 1512, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4906}, {"surface": "primary particulate emissions", "start": 1596, "end": 1625, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8412}, {"surface": "secondary aerosol precursors", "start": 1653, "end": 1681, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9009}, {"surface": "fossil fuel combustion", "start": 1701, "end": 1723, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.425}, {"surface": "China's PM2.5 levels", "start": 1786, "end": 1806, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4992}, {"surface": "particulate pollution", "start": 1886, "end": 1907, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8305}]}

Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions, statistical extrapolation of regional data and satellite imagery, but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images, we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal.

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 °C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017-2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018-2020 period.", "domain_category": "earth_science", "spans": [{"surface": "future climate change", "start": 15, "end": 36, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9527}, {"surface": "societal risks", "start": 136, "end": 150, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7936}, {"surface": "Scenario Model Intercomparison", "start": 177, "end": 207, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9041}, {"surface": "ScenarioMIP", "start": 217, "end": 228, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8288}, {"surface": "Coupled", "start": 276, "end": 283, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4164}, {"surface": "multi", "start": 340, "end": 345, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7016}, {"surface": "future emissions and land use changes", "start": 406, "end": 443, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9081}, {"surface": "integrated assessment", "start": 458, "end": 479, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5398}, {"surface": "ScenarioMIP", "start": 515, "end": 526, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9162}, {"surface": "CMIP6", "start": 606, "end": 611, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.7708}, {"surface": "ScenarioMIP", "start": 617, "end": 628, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7859}, {"surface": "scenario process", "start": 665, "end": 681, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7167}, {"surface": "integrated", "start": 722, "end": 732, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5781}, {"surface": "the climate", "start": 748, "end": 759, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.5062}, {"surface": "integrated assessment", "start": 769, "end": 790, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5653}, {"surface": "impacts, adaptation,", "start": 805, "end": 825, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6054}, {"surface": "vulnerability communities", "start": 830, "end": 855, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4267}, {"surface": "targeted", "start": 1065, "end": 1073, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6235}, {"surface": "scenario-based", "start": 1135, "end": 1149, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.926}, {"surface": "specific forcings", "start": 1182, "end": 1199, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7358}, {"surface": "land use and aerosols", "start": 1208, "end": 1229, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8005}, {"surface": "a", "start": 1245, "end": 1246, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7668}, {"surface": "peak and decline in", "start": 1247, "end": 1266, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4897}, {"surface": "forcing", "start": 1267, "end": 1274, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5415}, {"surface": "scenarios", "start": 1296, "end": 1305, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7339}, {"surface": "limit", "start": 1311, "end": 1316, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4333}, {"surface": "warming to", "start": 1317, "end": 1327, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.707}, {"surface": "below", "start": 1328, "end": 1333, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3387}, {"surface": "2 °C", "start": 1334, "end": 1338, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4639}, {"surface": "uncertainty", "start": 1370, "end": 1381, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9069}, {"surface": "scenarios", "start": 1387, "end": 1396, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8858}, {"surface": "climate models,", "start": 1398, "end": 1413, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5178}, {"surface": "long", "start": 1444, "end": 1448, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5643}, {"surface": "scientific", "start": 1531, "end": 1541, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3756}, {"surface": "21st century scenarios", "start": 1644, "end": 1666, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5768}, {"surface": "large initial condition ensemble", "start": 1676, "end": 1708, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6184}, {"surface": "long-term extensions", "start": 1722, "end": 1742, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8465}, {"surface": "CMIP6-", "start": 1887, "end": 1893, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.6195}, {"surface": "spatially explicit", "start": 1974, "end": 1992, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4992}, {"surface": "emissions and land use scenarios", "start": 1993, "end": 2025, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5135}, {"surface": "integrated assessment models", "start": 2041, "end": 2069, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.718}, {"surface": "climate modeling", "start": 2104, "end": 2120, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5168}, {"surface": "climate", "start": 2151, "end": 2158, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5691}, {"surface": "climate model", "start": 2234, "end": 2247, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6376}]}

Estimates of the above-canopy fluxes are needed for quantitative earth system studies and assessments of past, present and future air quality and climate. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) is described and used to quantify net terrestrial biosphere emission of isoprene into the atmosphere. MEGAN is designed for both global and regional emission modeling and has global coverage with ~1 km2 spatial resolution. Field and laboratory investigations of the processes controlling isoprene emission are described and data available for model development and evaluation are summarized. The factors controlling isoprene emissions include biological, physical and chemical driving variables. MEGAN driving variables are derived from models and satellite and ground observations. Tropical broadleaf trees contribute almost half of the estimated global annual isoprene emission due to their relatively high emission factors and because they are often exposed to conditions that are conducive for isoprene emission. The remaining flux is primarily from shrubs which have a widespread distribution. The annual global isoprene emission estimated with MEGAN ranges from about 500 to 750 Tg isoprene (440 to 660 Tg carbon) depending on the driving variables which include temperature, solar radiation, Leaf Area Index, and plant functional type. The global annual isoprene emission estimated using the standard driving variables is ~600 Tg isoprene. Differences in driving variables result in emission estimates that differ by more than a factor of three for specific times and locations. It is difficult to evaluate isoprene emission estimates using the concentration distributions simulated using chemistry and transport models, due to the substantial uncertainties in other model components, but at least some global models produce reasonable results when using isoprene emission distributions similar to MEGAN estimates. In addition, comparison with isoprene emissions estimated from satellite formaldehyde observations indicates reasonable agreement. The sensitivity of isoprene emissions to earth system changes (e.g., climate and land-use) demonstrates the potential for large future changes in emissions. Using temperature distributions simulated by global climate models for year 2100, MEGAN estimates that isoprene emissions increase by more than a factor of two. This is considerably greater than previous estimates and additional observations are needed to evaluate and improve the methods used to predict future isoprene emissions.", "domain_category": "earth_science", "spans": [{"surface": "Reactive gases and aerosols", "start": 0, "end": 27, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9349}, {"surface": "terrestrial ecosystems, processed", "start": 44, "end": 77, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4861}, {"surface": "above-canopy fluxes", "start": 176, "end": 195, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8183}, {"surface": "earth system", "start": 224, "end": 236, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4501}, {"surface": "past", "start": 264, "end": 268, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8136}, {"surface": "air quality and climate", "start": 289, "end": 312, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6635}, {"surface": "Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from", "start": 327, "end": 363, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.638}, {"surface": "Nature (", "start": 364, "end": 372, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6139}, {"surface": "MEGAN", "start": 372, "end": 377, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7126}, {"surface": "net terrestrial biosphere emission of", "start": 413, "end": 450, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8477}, {"surface": "isoprene", "start": 451, "end": 459, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9482}, {"surface": "MEGAN", "start": 481, "end": 486, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7792}, {"surface": "isoprene emission", "start": 667, "end": 684, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9321}, {"surface": "isoprene emissions", "start": 795, "end": 813, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9121}, {"surface": "biological", "start": 822, "end": 832, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5429}, {"surface": "MEGAN", "start": 875, "end": 880, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7511}, {"surface": "Tropical", "start": 962, "end": 970, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7025}, {"surface": "broadleaf trees", "start": 971, "end": 986, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4346}, {"surface": "global annual", "start": 1027, "end": 1040, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5739}, {"surface": "isoprene emission", "start": 1041, "end": 1058, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5032}, {"surface": "emission factors", "start": 1088, "end": 1104, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4182}, {"surface": "isoprene emission", "start": 1177, "end": 1194, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8536}, {"surface": "shrubs", "start": 1233, "end": 1239, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4389}, {"surface": "isoprene emission", "start": 1296, "end": 1313, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5771}, {"surface": "MEGAN", "start": 1329, "end": 1334, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7919}, {"surface": "temperature", "start": 1448, "end": 1459, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5937}, {"surface": "solar radiation", "start": 1461, "end": 1476, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.493}, {"surface": "plant functional type", "start": 1499, "end": 1520, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4993}, {"surface": "isoprene emission", "start": 1540, "end": 1557, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6765}, {"surface": "standard", "start": 1578, "end": 1586, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4377}, {"surface": "isoprene", "start": 1616, "end": 1624, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5529}, {"surface": "isoprene", "start": 1793, "end": 1801, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9205}, {"surface": "concentration distributions", "start": 1831, "end": 1858, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6238}, {"surface": "chemistry", "start": 1875, "end": 1884, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5865}, {"surface": "isoprene emission", "start": 2041, "end": 2058, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6761}, {"surface": "MEGA", "start": 2084, "end": 2088, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5667}, {"surface": "isoprene emissions", "start": 2130, "end": 2148, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8683}, {"surface": "isoprene emissions", "start": 2251, "end": 2269, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9363}, {"surface": "earth system", "start": 2273, "end": 2285, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5473}, {"surface": "temperature distributions", "start": 2395, "end": 2420, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7751}, {"surface": "global climate", "start": 2434, "end": 2448, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5822}, {"surface": "MEGA", "start": 2471, "end": 2475, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6504}, {"surface": "isoprene emissions", "start": 2492, "end": 2510, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9266}, {"surface": "isoprene emissions", "start": 2701, "end": 2719, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8934}]}

The corresponding spectrum isΩ(ω)=σβμ1ω(ω2+τ-2)1/2The rms average far-field spectrum is given by<Ω(ω)>=<Rθϕ>σβμrRF(ɛ)1ω2+α2where <Rθϕ> is the rms average of the radiation pattern; r is the radius of an equivalent circular dislocation surface; R is the distance; F(ɛ) = {[2 - 2ɛ][1 - cos (1.21 ɛω/α)] +ɛ2}1/2 ɛ is the fraction of stress drop; and α = 2.21 β/r. The rms spectrum falls off as (ω/α)-2 at very high frequencies. For values of ω/α between 1 and 10 the rms spectrum falls off as (ω/α)-1 for ɛ < ∼0.1. At low frequencies the spectrum reduces to the spectrum for a double-couple point source of appropriate moment.

Coupled to strong fluctuations at the 50-hPa level on the intraseasonal, interannual, and interdecadal time scales, this “Arctic Oscillation” (AO) can be interpreted as the surface signature of modulations in the strength of the polar vortex aloft. It is proposed that the zonally asymmetric surface air temperature and mid-tropospheric circulation anomalies observed in association with the AO may be secondary baroclinic features induced by the land-sea contrasts. The same modal structure is mirrored in the pronounced trends in winter and springtime surface air temperature, sea-level pressure, and 50-hPa height over the past 30 years: parts of Eurasia have warmed by as much as several K, sea-level pressure over parts of the Arctic has fallen by 4 hPa, and the core of the lower stratospheric polar vortex has cooled by several K.

Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an \"observer\" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints.

They are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about largely through human transport and commerce. In a world without borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these immigrations. The fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. Few survive the hazards of chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become naturalized. In turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. There are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. Ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. Whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) Animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) Plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species. (3) In agriculture, the principal pests of temperate crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and crop losses constitute an onerous \"tax\" on food, fiber, and forage production. (4) The global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable. Identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and establishment constitutes an enormous challenge to both conservation and international commerce. Detection and management when exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) Efforts to identify general attributes of future invaders have often been inconclusive. (2) Predicting susceptible locales for future invasions seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates of arrival among potential invaders. (3) Eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy. Successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) Control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term, ecosystem-wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on battling individual invaders. (5) Prevention of invasions is much less costly than post-entry control. Revamping national and international quarantine laws by adopting a \"guilty until proven innocent\" approach would be a productive first step. Failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions, disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous, impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. Given their current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of global change.

It is based on forecasting the error statistics using Monte Carlo methods, a better alternative than solving the traditional and computationally extremely demanding approximate error covariance equation used in the extended Kalman filter. The unbounded error growth found in the extended Kalman filter, which is caused by an overly simplified closure in the error covariance equation, is completely eliminated. Open boundaries can be handled as long as the ocean model is well posed. Well-known numerical instabilities associated with the error covariance equation are avoided because storage and evolution of the error covariance matrix itself are not needed. The results are also better than what is provided by the extended Kalman filter since there is no closure problem and the quality of the forecast error statistics therefore improves. The method should be feasible also for more sophisticated primitive equation models. The computational load for reasonable accuracy is only a fraction of what is required for the extended Kalman filter and is given by the storage of, say, 100 model states for an ensemble size of 100 and thus CPU requirements of the order of the cost of 100 model integrations.

{"bibcode": "2005GCBio..11.1424R", "title": "On the separation of net ecosystem exchange into assimilation and ecosystem respiration: review and improved algorithm", "abstract_clean": "This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods that separate net ecosystem exchange (NEE) into its major components, gross ecosystem carbon uptake (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). In particular, we analyse the effect of the extrapolation of night-time values of ecosystem respiration into the daytime; this is usually done with a temperature response function that is derived from long-term data sets. For this analysis, we used 16 one-year-long data sets of carbon dioxide exchange measurements from European and US-American eddy covariance networks. These sites span from the boreal to Mediterranean climates, and include deciduous and evergreen forest, scrubland and crop ecosystems. We show that the temperature sensitivity of Reco, derived from long-term (annual) data sets, does not reflect the short-term temperature sensitivity that is effective when extrapolating from night- to daytime. Specifically, in summer active ecosystems the long-term temperature sensitivity exceeds the short-term sensitivity. Thus, in those ecosystems, the application of a long-term temperature sensitivity to the extrapolation of respiration from night to day leads to a systematic overestimation of ecosystem respiration from half-hourly to annual time-scales, which can reach >25% for an annual budget and which consequently affects estimates of GEP. Conversely, in summer passive (Mediterranean) ecosystems, the long-term temperature sensitivity is lower than the short-term temperature sensitivity resulting in underestimation of annual sums of respiration. We introduce a new generic algorithm that derives a short-term temperature sensitivity of Reco from eddy covariance data that applies this to the extrapolation from night- to daytime, and that further performs a filling of data gaps that exploits both, the covariance between fluxes and meteorological drivers and the temporal structure of the fluxes. While this algorithm should give less biased estimates of GEP and Reco, we discuss the remaining biases and recommend that eddy covariance measurements are still backed by ancillary flux measurements that can reduce the uncertainties inherent in the eddy covariance data.", "domain_category": "earth_science", "spans": [{"surface": "net ecosystem exchange (NEE)", "start": 93, "end": 121, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9044}, {"surface": "gross ecosystem carbon uptake (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco)", "start": 149, "end": 217, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8058}, {"surface": "night-time values of", "start": 280, "end": 300, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.966}, {"surface": "ecosystem respiration", "start": 301, "end": 322, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8397}, {"surface": "temperature response", "start": 369, "end": 389, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6903}, {"surface": "carbon dioxide exchange measurements", "start": 498, "end": 534, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8805}, {"surface": "European and", "start": 540, "end": 552, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.6256}, {"surface": "US-American eddy covariance networks", "start": 553, "end": 589, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.8208}, {"surface": "the boreal to", "start": 613, "end": 626, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.5258}, {"surface": "Mediterranean climates", "start": 627, "end": 649, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.3598}, {"surface": "decid", "start": 663, "end": 668, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.3803}, {"surface": "temperature", "start": 743, "end": 754, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5778}, {"surface": "Reco", "start": 770, "end": 774, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9394}, {"surface": "annual", "start": 800, "end": 806, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4226}, {"surface": "night-", "start": 917, "end": 923, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8657}, {"surface": "daytime", "start": 927, "end": 934, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5072}, {"surface": "summer active ecosystems", "start": 953, "end": 977, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9213}, {"surface": "those", "start": 1061, "end": 1066, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5934}, {"surface": "long", "start": 1100, "end": 1104, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4939}, {"surface": "temperature", "start": 1110, "end": 1121, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6047}, {"surface": "extrapolation of", "start": 1141, "end": 1157, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4324}, {"surface": "respiration", "start": 1158, "end": 1169, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6562}, {"surface": "night", "start": 1175, "end": 1180, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8358}, {"surface": "day", "start": 1184, "end": 1187, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6884}, {"surface": "ecosystem respiration", "start": 1228, "end": 1249, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8969}, {"surface": "half-hourly", "start": 1255, "end": 1266, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9548}, {"surface": "annual time-scales", "start": 1270, "end": 1288, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.791}, {"surface": "annual budget", "start": 1318, "end": 1331, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4782}, {"surface": "GEP", "start": 1376, "end": 1379, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8975}, {"surface": "summer passive (Mediterranean) ecosystems", "start": 1396, "end": 1437, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9162}, {"surface": "annual sums of respiration", "start": 1562, "end": 1588, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9393}, {"surface": "short", "start": 1642, "end": 1647, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5659}, {"surface": "temperature", "start": 1653, "end": 1664, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5497}, {"surface": "Reco", "start": 1680, "end": 1684, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9466}, {"surface": "eddy covariance data", "start": 1690, "end": 1710, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6747}, {"surface": "night-", "start": 1755, "end": 1761, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8351}, {"surface": "daytime", "start": 1765, "end": 1772, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6205}, {"surface": "data gaps", "start": 1813, "end": 1822, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5064}, {"surface": "fluxes", "start": 1866, "end": 1872, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6929}, {"surface": "meteorological drivers", "start": 1877, "end": 1899, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.652}, {"surface": "GEP", "start": 2000, "end": 2003, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9615}, {"surface": "Reco", "start": 2008, "end": 2012, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.93}, {"surface": "eddy covariance measurements", "start": 2065, "end": 2093, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8819}]}

We have developed a global model to estimate emissions of volatile organic compounds from natural sources (NVOC). Methane is not considered here and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere. The model has a highly resolved spatial grid (0.5°×0.5° latitude/longitude) and generates hourly average emission estimates. Chemical species are grouped into four categories: isoprene, monoterpenes, other reactive VOC (ORVOC), and other VOC (OVOC). NVOC emissions from oceans are estimated as a function of geophysical variables from a general circulation model and ocean color satellite data. Emissions from plant foliage are estimated from ecosystem specific biomass and emission factors and algorithms describing light and temperature dependence of NVOC emissions. Foliar density estimates are based on climatic variables and satellite data. Temporal variations in the model are driven by monthly estimates of biomass and temperature and hourly light estimates. The annual global VOC flux is estimated to be 1150 Tg C, composed of 44% isoprene, 11% monoterpenes, 22.5% other reactive VOC, and 22.5% other VOC. Large uncertainties exist for each of these estimates and particularly for compounds other than isoprene and monoterpenes. Tropical woodlands (rain forest, seasonal, drought-deciduous, and savanna) contribute about half of all global natural VOC emissions.

{"bibcode": "2000EcMod.135..147G", "title": "Predictive habitat distribution models in ecology", "abstract_clean": "With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone.", "domain_category": "earth_science", "spans": [{"surface": "predictive", "start": 87, "end": 97, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8701}, {"surface": "habitat distribution models", "start": 98, "end": 125, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6957}, {"surface": "geographical distribution", "start": 248, "end": 273, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7011}, {"surface": "species or communities", "start": 277, "end": 299, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7318}, {"surface": "biogeography", "start": 403, "end": 415, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8913}, {"surface": "conservation biology", "start": 417, "end": 437, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7637}, {"surface": "climate change research", "start": 439, "end": 462, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6713}, {"surface": "habitat or species management", "start": 468, "end": 497, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7666}, {"surface": "predictive", "start": 537, "end": 547, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9238}, {"surface": "habitat distribution modeling", "start": 548, "end": 577, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7528}, {"surface": "Ordinary multiple regression", "start": 634, "end": 662, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8287}, {"surface": "its generalized form (", "start": 667, "end": 689, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4553}, {"surface": "GLM)", "start": 689, "end": 693, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5092}, {"surface": "species distributions", "start": 743, "end": 764, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9111}, {"surface": "neural networks", "start": 788, "end": 803, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7174}, {"surface": "ordination and classification methods", "start": 805, "end": 842, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7646}, {"surface": "Bayesian models", "start": 844, "end": 859, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8037}, {"surface": "locally weighted approaches (", "start": 861, "end": 890, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.749}, {"surface": "GAM)", "start": 895, "end": 899, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8242}, {"surface": "environmental envelopes", "start": 901, "end": 924, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8567}, {"surface": "theoretical", "start": 1099, "end": 1110, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3772}, {"surface": "the", "start": 1147, "end": 1150, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5889}, {"surface": "species' response (", "start": 1151, "end": 1170, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5578}, {"surface": "realized niche)", "start": 1173, "end": 1188, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7207}, {"surface": "accuracy", "start": 1262, "end": 1270, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6663}, {"surface": "generality", "start": 1289, "end": 1299, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6006}, {"surface": "static distribution modeling", "start": 1317, "end": 1345, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9723}, {"surface": "threshold", "start": 1507, "end": 1516, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5601}, {"surface": "receiver operating characteristic (", "start": 1544, "end": 1579, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6166}, {"surface": "ROC)-plots", "start": 1579, "end": 1589, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5192}, {"surface": "bootstrap", "start": 1623, "end": 1632, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5821}, {"surface": "predictive models", "start": 1712, "end": 1729, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7447}, {"surface": "prediction errors", "start": 1908, "end": 1925, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4583}, {"surface": "omission", "start": 1932, "end": 1940, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8346}, {"surface": "commission", "start": 1942, "end": 1952, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7976}, {"surface": "confusion", "start": 1956, "end": 1965, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7925}]}

We have obtained a new set of present-day mean values in chondrites of 176Hf/ 177Hf= 0.282772 ± 29 and 176Lu/ 177Hf= 0.0332 ± 2. The 176Hf/ 177Hf ratio of the Solar System material 4.56 Ga ago was 0.279742 ± 29. Because the mantle array lies above the Bulk Silicate Earth in a 143Nd/ 144Nd versus 176Hf/ 177Hf plot, no terrestrial basalt seems to have formed from a primitive undifferentiated mantle, thereby casting doubt on the significance of high 3He/ 4He ratios. Comparison of observedHf/Nd ratios with those inferred from isotopic plots indicates that, in addition to the two most prominent components at the surface of the Earth, the depleted mantle and the continental crust, at least one more reservoir, which is not a significant component in the source of oceanic basalts, is needed to account for the Bulk Silicate Earth Hf-Nd geochemistry. This unaccounted for component probably consists of subducted basalts, representing ancient oceanic crust and plateaus.

{"bibcode": "1998ChGeo.145..325P", "title": "The chemical composition of subducting sediment and its consequences for the crust and mantle", "abstract_clean": "Subducted sediments play an important role in arc magmatism and crust-mantle recycling. Models of continental growth, continental composition, convergent margin magmatism and mantle heterogeneity all require a better understanding of the mass and chemical fluxes associated with subducting sediments. We have evaluated subducting sediments on a global basis in order to better define their chemical systematics and to determine both regional and global average compositions. We then use these compositions to assess the importance of sediments to arc volcanism and crust-mantle recycling, and to re-evaluate the chemical composition of the continental crust. The large variations in the chemical composition of marine sediments are for the most part linked to the main lithological constituents. The alkali elements (K, Rb and Cs) and high field strength elements (Ti, Nb, Hf, Zr) are closely linked to the detrital phase in marine sediments; Th is largely detrital but may be enriched in the hydrogenous Fe-Mn component of sediments; REE patterns are largely continental, but abundances are closely linked to fish debris phosphate; U is mostly detrital, but also dependent on the supply and burial rate of organic matter; Ba is linked to both biogenic barite and hydrothermal components; Sr is linked to carbonate phases. Thus, the important geochemical tracers follow the lithology of the sediments. Sediment lithologies are controlled in turn by a small number of factors: proximity of detrital sources (volcanic and continental); biological productivity and preservation of carbonate and opal; and sedimentation rate. Because of the link with lithology and the wealth of lithological data routinely collected for ODP and DSDP drill cores, bulk geochemical averages can be calculated to better than 30% for most elements from fewer than ten chemical analyses for a typical drill core (100-1000 m). Combining the geochemical systematics with convergence rate and other parameters permits calculation of regional compositional fluxes for subducting sediment. These regional fluxes can be compared to the compositions of arc volcanics to asses the importance of sediment subduction to arc volcanism. For the 70% of the trenches worldwide where estimates can be made, the regional fluxes also provide the basis for a global subducting sediment (GLOSS) composition and flux. GLOSS is dominated by terrigenous material (76 wt% terrigenous, 7 wt% calcium carbonate, 10 wt% opal, 7 wt% mineral-bound H 2O +), and therefore similar to upper continental crust (UCC) in composition. Exceptions include enrichment in Ba, Mn and the middle and heavy REE, and depletions in detrital elements diluted by biogenic material (alkalis, Th, Zr, Hf). Sr and Pb are identical in GLOSS and UCC as a result of a balance between dilution and enrichment by marine phases. GLOSS and the systematics of marine sediments provide an independent approach to the composition of the upper continental crust for detrital elements. Significant discrepancies of up to a factor of two exist between the marine sediment data and current upper crustal estimates for Cs, Nb, Ta and Ti. Suggested revisions to UCC include Cs (7.3 ppm), Nb (13.7 ppm), Ta (0.96 ppm) and TiO 2 (0.76 wt%). These revisions affect recent bulk continental crust estimates for La/Nb and U/Nb, and lead to an even greater contrast between the continents and mantle for these important trace element ratios. GLOSS and the regional sediment data also provide new insights into the mantle sources of oceanic basalts. The classical geochemical distinction between `pelagic' and `terrigenous' sediment sources is not valid and needs to be replaced by a more comprehensive understanding of the compositional variations in complete sedimentary columns. In addition, isotopic arguments based on surface sediments alone can lead to erroneous conclusions. Specifically, the Nd/Hf ratio of GLOSS relaxes considerably the severe constraints on the amount of sediment recycling into the mantle based on earlier estimates from surface sediment compositions.",

At present over 140 sites are operating on a long-term and continuous basis. Vegetation under study includes temperate conifer and broadleaved (deciduous and evergreen) forests, tropical and boreal forests, crops, grasslands, chaparral, wetlands, and tundra. Sites exist on five continents and their latitudinal distribution ranges from 70°N to 30°S. FLUXNET has several primary functions. First, it provides infrastructure for compiling, archiving, and distributing carbon, water, and energy flux measurement, and meteorological, plant, and soil data to the science community. (Data and site information are available online at the FLUXNET www-eosdis.ornl.gov/FLUXNET/.) Second, the project supports calibration and flux intercomparison activities. This activity ensures that data from the regional networks are intercomparable. And third, FLUXNET supports the synthesis, discussion, and communication of ideas and data by supporting project scientists, workshops, and visiting scientists. The overarching goal is to provide information for validating computations of net primary productivity, evaporation, and energy absorption that are being generated by sensors mounted on the NASA Terra satellite. Data being compiled by FLUXNET are being used to quantify and compare magnitudes and dynamics of annual ecosystem carbon and water balances, to quantify the response of stand-scale carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities to controlling biotic and abiotic factors, and to validate a hierarchy of soil-plant-atmosphere trace gas exchange models. Findings so far include 1) net CO2 exchange of temperate broadleaved forests increases by about 5.7 g C m-2 day-1 for each additional day that the growing season is extended; 2) the sensitivity of net ecosystem CO2 exchange to sunlight doubles if the sky is cloudy rather than clear; 3) the spectrum of CO2 flux density exhibits peaks at timescales of days, weeks, and years, and a spectral gap exists at the month timescale; 4) the optimal temperature of net CO2 exchange varies with mean summer temperature; and 5) stand age affects carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities.", "domain_category": "earth_science", "spans": [{"surface": "FLUXNET", "start": 0, "end": 7, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7036}, {"surface": "micrometeorological flux measurement sites", "start": 31, "end": 73, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9783}, {"surface": "carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between", "start": 104, "end": 151, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8901}, {"surface": "the biosphere", "start": 152, "end": 165, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7177}, {"surface": "atmosphere", "start": 170, "end": 180, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5401}, {"surface": "temperate conifer and broadleaved (deciduous and evergreen) forests", "start": 291, "end": 358, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8355}, {"surface": "70", "start": 519, "end": 521, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.2725}, {"surface": "FLUXNET", "start": 533, "end": 540, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6987}, {"surface": "carbon, water, and energy flux measurement, and meteorological, plant, and soil data", "start": 649, "end": 733, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7081}, {"surface": "FLUX", "start": 815, "end": 819, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6636}, {"surface": "eosd", "start": 827, "end": 831, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.578}, {"surface": "ornl", "start": 834, "end": 838, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.5113}, {"surface": "FLUX", "start": 843, "end": 847, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4825}, {"surface": "calibration", "start": 883, "end": 894, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8115}, {"surface": "flux", "start": 899, "end": 903, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6266}, {"surface": "FLUX", "start": 1023, "end": 1027, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7178}, {"surface": "ideas", "start": 1088, "end": 1093, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6593}, {"surface": "project", "start": 1117, "end": 1124, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5763}, {"surface": "net primary productivity, evaporation, and energy absorption", "start": 1251, "end": 1311, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9739}, {"surface": "NASA Terra", "start": 1363, "end": 1373, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.345}, {"surface": "FLUX", "start": 1408, "end": 1412, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.699}, {"surface": "annual ecosystem carbon and water balances", "start": 1482, "end": 1524, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9781}, {"surface": "stand-scale carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities", "start": 1554, "end": 1611, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9179}, {"surface": "soil-plant-atmosphere trace gas exchange", "start": 1686, "end": 1726, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9337}, {"surface": "net CO2 exchange of", "start": 1762, "end": 1781, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8654}, {"surface": "temperate broadleaved forests", "start": 1782, "end": 1811, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.905}, {"surface": "net ecosystem CO2 exchange", "start": 1932, "end": 1958, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9442}, {"surface": "sunlight", "start": 1962, "end": 1970, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.841}, {"surface": "cloudy", "start": 1993, "end": 1999, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3641}, {"surface": "CO2 flux density", "start": 2038, "end": 2054, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9223}, {"surface": "optimal", "start": 2168, "end": 2175, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5011}, {"surface": "net CO2 exchange", "start": 2191, "end": 2207, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8733}, {"surface": "mean", "start": 2220, "end": 2224, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.865}, {"surface": "summer", "start": 2225, "end": 2231, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5509}, {"surface": "stand age", "start": 2252, "end": 2261, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8239}, {"surface": "carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities", "start": 2270, "end": 2315, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9188}]}

Part I: Month-to-Month Variability*.", "abstract_clean": "The leading modes of variability of the extratropical circulation in both hemispheres are characterized by deep, zonally symmetric or `annular' structures, with geopotential height perturbations of opposing signs in the polar cap region and in the surrounding zonal ring centered near 45° latitude. The structure and dynamics of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode have been extensively documented, whereas the existence of a Northern Hemisphere (NH) mode, herein referred to as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), has only recently been recognized. Like the SH mode, the AO can be defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function of the sea level pressure field or of the zonally symmetric geopotential height or zonal wind fields. In this paper the structure and seasonality of the NH and SH modes are compared based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis and supplementary datasets.The structures of the NH and SH annular modes are shown to be remarkably similar, not only in the zonally averaged geopotential height and zonal wind fields, but in the mean meridional circulations as well. Both exist year-round in the troposphere, but they amplify with height upward into the stratosphere during those seasons in which the strength of the zonal flow is conducive to strong planetary wave-mean flow interaction: midwinter in the NH and late spring in the SH. During these `active seasons,' the annular modes modulate the strength of the Lagrangian mean circulation in the lower stratosphere, total column ozone and tropopause height over mid- and high latitudes, and the strength of the trade winds of their respective hemispheres. The NH mode also contains an embedded planetary wave signature with expressions in surface air temperature, precipitation, total column ozone, and tropopause height. It is argued that the horizontal temperature advection by the perturbed zonal-mean zonal wind field in the lower troposphere is instrumental in forcing this pattern.A companion paper documents the striking resemblance between the structure of the annular modes and observed climate trends over the past few decades.", "domain_category": "planetary_science", "spans": [{"surface": "leading modes

We obtain the gravitational field equations in the metric formalism, as well as the equations of motion for test particles, which follow from the covariant divergence of the stress-energy tensor. Generally, the gravitational field equations depend on the nature of the matter source. The field equations of several particular models, corresponding to some explicit forms of the function f(R,T), are also presented. An important case, which is analyzed in detail, is represented by scalar field models. We write down the action and briefly consider the cosmological implications of the f(R,Tϕ) models, where Tϕ is the trace of the stress-energy tensor of a self-interacting scalar field. The equations of motion of the test particles are also obtained from a variational principle.

Deep-sea limestones exposed in Italy, Denmark, and New Zealand show iridium increases of about 30, 160, and 20 times, respectively, above the background level at precisely the time of the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions, 65 million years ago. Reasons are given to indicate that this iridium is of extraterrestrial origin, but did not come from a nearby supernova. A hypothesis is suggested which accounts for the extinctions and the iridium observations. Impact of a large earth-crossing asteroid would inject about 60 times the object's mass into the atmosphere as pulverized rock; a fraction of this dust would stay in the stratosphere for several years and be distributed worldwide. The resulting darkness would suppress photosynthesis, and the expected biological consequences match quite closely the extinctions observed in the paleontological record. One prediction of this hypothesis has been verified: the chemical composition of the boundary clay, which is thought to come from the stratospheric dust, is markedly different from that of clay mixed with the Cretaceous and Tertiary limestones, which are chemically similar to each other.

In keeping with SDSS tradition, SDSS-III will provide regular public releases of all its data, beginning with SDSS Data Release 8 (DR8), which was made public in 2011 January and includes SDSS-I and SDSS-II images and spectra reprocessed with the latest pipelines and calibrations produced for the SDSS-III investigations. This paper presents an overview of the four surveys that comprise SDSS-III. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey will measure redshifts of 1.5 million massive galaxies and Lyα forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using the baryon acoustic oscillation feature of large-scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations of the distance scale and Hubble expansion rate at z < 0.7 and at z ≈ 2.5. SEGUE-2, an already completed SDSS-III survey that is the continuation of the SDSS-II Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE), measured medium-resolution (R = λ/Δλ ≈ 1800) optical spectra of 118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution, stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matter halo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. APOGEE, the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment, will obtain high-resolution (R ≈ 30,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N >= 100 per resolution element), H-band (1.51 μm < λ < 1.70 μm) spectra of 105 evolved, late-type stars, measuring separate abundances for ~15 elements per star and creating the first high-precision spectroscopic survey of all Galactic stellar populations (bulge, bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectral diagnostics. The Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS) will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 FGK stars with the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m s-1, ~24 visits per star) needed to detect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an unprecedented data set for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. As of 2011 January, SDSS-III has obtained spectra of more than 240,000 galaxies, 29,000 z >= 2.2 quasars, and 140,000 stars, including 74,000 velocity measurements of 2580 stars for MARVELS.",

{"bibcode": "2010GeoJI.181....1D", "title": "Geologically current plate motions", "abstract_clean": "We describe best-fitting angular velocities and MORVEL, a new closure-enforced set of angular velocities for the geologically current motions of 25 tectonic plates that collectively occupy 97 per cent of Earth's surface. Seafloor spreading rates and fault azimuths are used to determine the motions of 19 plates bordered by mid-ocean ridges, including all the major plates. Six smaller plates with little or no connection to the mid-ocean ridges are linked to MORVEL with GPS station velocities and azimuthal data. By design, almost no kinematic information is exchanged between the geologically determined and geodetically constrained subsets of the global circuit-MORVEL thus averages motion over geological intervals for all the major plates. Plate geometry changes relative to NUVEL-1A include the incorporation of Nubia, Lwandle and Somalia plates for the former Africa plate, Capricorn, Australia and Macquarie plates for the former Australia plate, and Sur and South America plates for the former South America plate. MORVEL also includes Amur, Philippine Sea, Sundaland and Yangtze plates, making it more useful than NUVEL-1A for studies of deformation in Asia and the western Pacific. Seafloor spreading rates are estimated over the past 0.78 Myr for intermediate and fast spreading centres and since 3.16 Ma for slow and ultraslow spreading centres. Rates are adjusted downward by 0.6-2.6mmyr-1 to compensate for the several kilometre width of magnetic reversal zones. Nearly all the NUVEL-1A angular velocities differ significantly from the MORVEL angular velocities. The many new data, revised plate geometries, and correction for outward displacement thus significantly modify our knowledge of geologically current plate motions. MORVEL indicates significantly slower 0.78-Myr-average motion across the Nazca-Antarctic and Nazca-Pacific boundaries than does NUVEL-1A, consistent with a progressive slowdown in the eastward component of Nazca plate motion since 3.16 Ma. It also indicates that motions across the Caribbean-North America and Caribbean-South America plate boundaries are twice as fast as given by NUVEL-1A. Summed, least-squares differences between angular velocities estimated from GPS and those for MORVEL, NUVEL-1 and NUVEL-1A are, respectively, 260 per cent larger for NUVEL-1 and 50 per cent larger for NUVEL-1A than for MORVEL, suggesting that MORVEL more accurately describes historically current plate motions. Significant differences between geological and GPS estimates of Nazca plate motion and Arabia-Eurasia and India-Eurasia motion are reduced but not eliminated when using MORVEL instead of NUVEL-1A, possibly indicating that changes have occurred in those plate motions since 3.16 Ma. The MORVEL and GPS estimates of Pacific-North America plate motion in western North America differ by only 2.6 +/- 1.7mmyr-1, ~25 per cent smaller than for NUVEL-1A. The remaining difference for this plate pair, assuming there are no unrecognized systematic errors and no measurable change in Pacific-North America motion over the past 1-3 Myr, indicates deformation of one or more plates in the global circuit. Tests for closure of six three-plate circuits indicate that two, Pacific-Cocos-Nazca and Sur-Nubia-Antarctic, fail closure, with respective linear velocities of non-closure of 14 +/- 5 and 3 +/- 1mmyr-1 (95 per cent confidence limits) at their triple junctions. We conclude that the rigid plate approximation continues to be tremendously useful, but-absent any unrecognized systematic errors-the plates deform measurably, possibly by thermal contraction and wide plate boundaries with deformation rates near or beneath the level of noise in plate kinematic data.", "domain_category": "planetary_science", "spans": [{"surface": "best", "start": 12, "end": 16,

The impacts of the changing surface ice load upon both Earth's shape and gravitational field, as well as upon sea-level history, have come to be measurable using a variety of geological and geophysical techniques. These observations are invertible to obtain useful information on both the internal viscoelastic structure of the solid Earth and on the detailed spatiotemporal characteristics of glaciation history. This review focuses upon the most recent advances that have been achieved in each of these areas, advances that have proven to be central to the construction of the refined model of the global process of glacial isostatic adjustment, denoted ICE-5G (VM2).

{"bibcode": "1993Icar..101..108K", "title": "Habitable Zones around Main Sequence Stars", "abstract_clean": "A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.", "domain_category": "planetary_science", "spans":

{"bibcode": "1971JGR....76.3534B", "title": "Large-amplitude Alfvén waves in the interplanetary medium, 2", "abstract_clean": "An extensive study of the dynamic nonshock properties of the microscale fluctuations (scale lengths of 0.01 AU and less) in the interplanetary medium was made by using plasma and magnetic field data from Mariner 5 (Venus 1967). The observational results of the study are: (1) Large-amplitude, nonsinusoidal Alfvén waves propagating outward from the sun with a broad wavelength range from 103 to 5×106 km dominate the microscale structure at least 50% of the time; the waves frequently have energy densities comparable both to the unperturbed magnetic field energy density and to the thermal energy density. (2) The purest examples of these outwardly propagating Alfvén waves occur in high-velocity solar wind streams and on their trailing edges (where the velocity decreases slowly with time). In low-velocity regions Alfvén waves are also outwardly propagating but usually have smaller amplitudes than in the fast streams and tend to be less pure in the sense that they are more strongly intermixed with structures of a non-Alfvénic and possibly static nature. (3) The largest amplitude Alfvénic fluctuations are found in the compression regions at the leading edges of high-velocity streams where the velocity increases rapidly with time; these regions may contain significant amounts of inwardly propagating or non-Alfvénic wave modes. (4) Power spectra of the interplanetary magnetic field in the frequency range from 1/(107 min) to 1/(25.2 sec) have frequency dependencies of ƒ-1.5 to ƒ-2.2 the spectra with slower falloffs tend to be associated with higher temperature regions. (5) The microscale magnetic field fluctuations have on the average a 5∶4∶1 power anisotropy in an orthogonal coodinate system whose axes are (eB×eR, eB× (eB ×eR), eB), where eB is a unit vector in the average field direction and eR is a unit vector radially away from the sun; this anisotropy tends to be strongest (6∶3∶1) in the compression regions at the leading edges of high-velocity streams. (6) Presumably magnetoacoustic wave modes occur, but they have not been identified and, if present, have a small average power of the order of 10% or less of that in the Alfvén mode.These observations are organized on the basis of a model of the solar wind velocity structure. Most Alfvén waves in the interplanetary medium are likely the undamped remnants of waves generated at or near the sun. The high level of wave activity in high-velocity high-temperature streams can be interpreted as evidence for the extensive heating of these streams by wave damping near the sun. The highest level of Alfvénic wave activity in the compression regions at the leading edges of high-velocity streams may be due to either the amplification of ambient Alfvén waves in high-velocity streams as they are swept into the compression regions or the fresh generation of waves in these regions by the stream-stream interactions. The observed absence of the magnetoacoustic modes is evidence for their strong damping. The eB×eR anisotropy is viewed as due to the partial conversion of the Alfvén waves to the damped magnetoacoustic modes as they are convected away from the sun; this process continually transfers energy from the microscale field fluctuations to the thermalized solar wind plasma.", "domain_category": "planetary_science", "spans": [{"surface": "dynamic nonshock properties", "start": 26, "end":

{"bibcode": "2010ApJS..190....1R", "title": "A Survey of Stellar Families: Multiplicity of Solar-type Stars", "abstract_clean": "We present the results of a comprehensive assessment of companions to solar-type stars. A sample of 454 stars, including the Sun, was selected from the Hipparcos catalog with π>40 mas, σπ/π < 0.05, 0.5 <= B - V <= 1.0 (~F6-K3), and constrained by absolute magnitude and color to exclude evolved stars. These criteria are equivalent to selecting all dwarf and subdwarf stars within 25 pc with V-band flux between 0.1 and 10 times that of the Sun, giving us a physical basis for the term \"solar-type.\" New observational aspects of this work include surveys for (1) very close companions with long-baseline interferometry at the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array, (2) close companions with speckle interferometry, and (3) wide proper-motion companions identified by blinking multi-epoch archival images. In addition, we include the results from extensive radial-velocity monitoring programs and evaluate companion information from various catalogs covering many different techniques. The results presented here include four new common proper-motion companions discovered by blinking archival images. Additionally, the spectroscopic data searched reveal five new stellar companions. Our synthesis of results from many methods and sources results in a thorough evaluation of stellar and brown dwarf companions to nearby Sun-like stars. The overall observed fractions of single, double, triple, and higher-order systems are 56% ± 2%, 33% ± 2%, 8% ± 1%, and 3% ± 1%, respectively, counting all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions. If all candidate, i.e., unconfirmed, companions identified are found to be real, the percentages would change to 54% ± 2%, 34% ± 2%, 9% ± 2%, and 3% ± 1%, respectively. Our completeness analysis indicates that only a few undiscovered companions remain in this well-studied sample, implying that the majority (54% ± 2%) of solar-type stars are single, in contrast to the results of prior multiplicity studies. Our sample is large enough to enable a check of the multiplicity dependence on various physical parameters by analyzing appropriate subsamples. Bluer, more massive stars are seen as more likely to have companions than redder, less massive ones, consistent with the trend seen over the entire spectral range. Systems with larger interaction cross sections, i.e., those with more than two components or long orbital periods, are preferentially younger, suggesting that companions may be stripped over time by dynamical interactions. We confirm the planet-metallicity correlation (i.e., higher metallicity stars are more likely to host planets), but are unable to check it for brown dwarfs due to the paucity of such companions, implying that the brown dwarf desert extends over all separation regimes. We find no correlation between stellar companions and metallicity for B - V < 0.625, but among the redder subset, metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] <-0.3) are more likely to have companions with a 2.4σ significance. The orbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log normal with a peak and median of about 300 years. The period-eccentricity relation shows the expected circularization for periods below 12 days, caused by tidal forces over the age of the Galaxy, followed by a roughly flat distribution. The mass-ratio distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs, which occur more frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet hosts among single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that planets are as likely to form around single stars as they are around components of binary or multiple systems with sufficiently wide separations. This, along with the preference of long orbital periods among stellar systems, increases the space around stars conducive for planet formation, and perhaps life.", "domain_category": "planetary_science", "spans": [{"surface": "companions to", "start": 56, "end": 69, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8835}, {"surface": "solar-type stars", "start": 70, "end": 86, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.97}, {"surface": "the", "start": 121, "end": 124, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9272}, {"surface": "Sun,", "start": 125, "end": 129, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6675}, {"surface": "Hipparcos catalog", "start": 152, "end": 169, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8345}, {"surface": "π>", "start": 175, "end": 177, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8241}, {"surface": "40 mas", "start": 177, "end": 183, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5752}, {"surface": "σπ/π <", "start": 185, "end": 191, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7726}, {"surface": "0.5 <= B - V <= 1.0 (~F6-K3),", "start": 198, "end": 227, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.344}, {"surface": "absolute magnitude", "start": 247, "end": 265, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4378}, {"surface": "evolved stars.", "start": 287, "end": 301, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8464}, {"surface": "dwarf and", "start": 349, "end": 358, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9419}, {"surface": "subdwarf stars", "start": 359, "end": 373, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9079}, {"surface": "V-band flux between", "start": 392, "end": 411, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9099}, {"surface": "the", "start": 437, "end": 440, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8025}, {"surface": "Sun", "start": 441, "end": 444, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.465}, {"surface": "solar-type.", "start": 487, "end": 498, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9709}, {"surface": "very close companions", "start": 563, "end": 584, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8358}, {"surface": "long-baseline interferometry", "start": 590, "end": 618, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6377}, {"surface": "close companions", "start": 682, "end": 698, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9358}, {"surface": "speckle interferometry", "start": 704, "end": 726, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8381}, {"surface": "wide proper-motion companions", "start": 736, "end": 765, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9762}, {"surface": "blinking", "start": 780, "end": 788, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7204}, {"surface": "radial-velocity", "start": 869, "end": 884, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8765}, {"surface": "companion information", "start": 918, "end": 939, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8727}, {"surface": "common proper-motion companions", "start": 1042, "end": 1073, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9654}, {"surface": "blinking", "start": 1088, "end": 1096, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7877}, {"surface": "archival", "start": 1097, "end": 1105, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.385}, {"surface": "stellar companions", "start": 1176, "end": 1194, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6871}, {"surface": "stellar", "start": 1287, "end": 1294, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9637}, {"surface": "brown dwarf companions to", "start": 1299, "end": 1324, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9459}, {"surface": "nearby", "start": 1325, "end": 1331, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6977}, {"surface": "Sun-like stars", "start": 1332, "end": 1346, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.758}, {"surface": "single,", "start": 1382, "end": 1389, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9365}, {"surface": "double,", "start": 1390, "end": 1397, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9033}, {"surface": "triple,", "start": 1398, "end": 1405, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8708}, {"surface": "higher-order systems", "start": 1410, "end": 1430, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8334}, {"surface": "stellar", "start": 1514, "end": 1521, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8853}, {"surface": "brown dwarf companions", "start": 1526, "end": 1548, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.929}, {"surface": "candidate,", "start": 1557, "end": 1567, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6922}, {"surface": "real", "start": 1625, "end": 1629, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5628}, {"surface": "solar-type stars", "start": 1872, "end": 1888, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9786}, {"surface": "single", "start": 1893, "end": 1899, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7968}, {"surface": "multiplicity", "start": 1937, "end": 1949, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4998}, {"surface": "multiplicity", "start": 2011, "end": 2023, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.824}, {"surface": "Bluer,", "start": 2103, "end": 2109, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7239}, {"surface": "companions", "start": 2161, "end": 2171, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4901}, {"surface": "redder,", "start": 2177, "end": 2184, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5343}, {"surface": "interaction cross sections", "start": 2287, "end": 2313, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6159}]}

{"bibcode": "2006SSRv..123..485G", "title": "The James Webb Space Telescope", "abstract_clean": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large (6.6 m), cold (<50 K), infrared (IR)-optimized space observatory that will be launched early in the next decade into orbit around the second Earth Sun Lagrange point. The observatory will have four instruments: a near-IR camera, a near-IR multiobject spectrograph, and a tunable filter imager will cover the wavelength range, 0.6 < ; < 5.0 μ m, while the mid-IR instrument will do both imaging and spectroscopy from 5.0 < ; < 29 μ m. The JWST science goals are divided into four themes. The key objective of The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization theme is to identify the first luminous sources to form and to determine the ionization history of the early universe. The key objective of The Assembly of Galaxies theme is to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars, metals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved from the epoch of reionization to the present day. The key objective of The Birth of Stars and Protoplanetary Systems theme is to unravel the birth and early evolution of stars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetary systems. The key objective of the Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life theme is to determine the physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including our own, and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems. Within these themes and objectives, we have derived representative astronomical observations. To enable these observations, JWST consists of a telescope, an instrument package, a spacecraft, and a sunshield. The telescope consists of 18 beryllium segments, some of which are deployed. The segments will be brought into optical alignment on-orbit through a process of periodic wavefront sensing and control.

{"bibcode": "1990AJ.....99..924B", "title": "A Survey for Circumstellar Disks around Young Stellar Objects", "abstract_clean": "Continuum observations at 1.3 mm of 86 pre-main sequence stars in the Taurus-Auriga dark clouds show that 42% have detectable emission from small particles. The detected fraction is only slightly smaller for the weak-line and \"naked\" T Tauri stars than for classical T Tauris, indicating that the former stars often have circumstellar material. In both categories, the column densities of particles are too large to be compatible with spherical distributions of circumstellar matter -- the optical extinctions would be too large; the particles are almost certainly in spatially thin, circumstellar disks. Models of the spectral energy distributions from 10 to 1300 μm indicate that for the most part the disks are transparent at 1.3 mm, although the innermost (≪1 AU) regions are opaque even at millimeter wavelenths. The aggregate particle masses are between 10-5 and 10-2 M⊙. The disk mass does not decrease with increasing stellar age up to at least 107 years among the stars detected at 1.3 mm. There is some evidence for temperature evolution, in the sense that older disks are colder and less luminous. There is little correlation between disk mass and Hα equivalent width among the detected stars, suggesting that the Hα line is not by itself indicative of disk mass. Spectral indices for several sources between 1.3 and 2.7 mm suggest that the particle emissivities ɛ are weaker functions of frequency ν than is the usual case of interstellar grains. Particle growth via adhesion in the dense disks might explain this result. The typical disk has an angular momentum comparable to that generally accepted for the early solar nebula, but very little stored energy, almost five orders of magnitude smaller than that of the central star. Our results demonstrate that disks more massive than the minimum mass of the proto-solar system commonly accompany the birth of solar-mass stars and suggest that planetary systems are common in the

{"bibcode": "1980E&PSL..50..139J", "title": "Sm-Nd isotopic evolution of chondrites", "abstract_clean": "The 143Nd/ 144Nd and 147Sm/ 144Nd ratios have been measured in five chondrites and the Juvinas achondrite. The range in 143Nd/ 144Nd for the analyzed meteorite samples is 5.3 ɛ-units (0.511673-0.511944) normalized to 150Nd/ 142Nd= 0.2096 . This is correlated with the variation of 4.2% in 147Sm/ 144Nd (0.1920-0.2000). Much of this spread is due to small-scale heterogeneities in the chondrites and does not appear to reflect the large-scale volumetric averages. It is shown that none of the samples deviate more than 0.5 ɛ-units from a 4.6-AE reference isochron and define an initial 143Nd/ 144Nd ratio at 4.6 AE of 0.505828 ± 9. Insofar as there is a range of values of 147Sm/ 144Nd there is no unique way of picking solar or average chondritic values. From these data we have selected a new set of self-consistent present-day reference values for CHUR (\"chondritic uniform reservoir\") of ( 143Nd/ 144Nd) CHUR0 = 0.511836and( 147Sm/ 144Nd) CHUR0 = 0.1967 . The new 147Sm/ 144Nd value is 1.6% higher than the previous value assigned to CHUR using the Juvinas data of Lugmair. This will cause a small but significant change in the CHUR evolution curve. Some terrestrial samples of Archean age show clear deviations from the new CHUR curve. If the CHUR curve is representative of undifferentiated mantle then it demonstrates that depleted sources were also tapped early in the Archean. Such a depleted layer may represent the early evolution of the source of present-day mid-ocean ridge basalts.

Second, in order to see magnetic effect on the structure, electric conductivity of a gas ionized by cosmic rays and radioactivities contained in dust grains is estimated for each region of the nebula and, then, the growth and decay of seed magnetic fields, which are due to differential rotation of the nebula and to the Joule dissipation, respectively, are calculated. The results indicate that, in regions of the terrestrial planets, magnetic fields decay much faster than they grow and magnetic effects can be ignored, except for the outermost layers of very low density. This is not the case for regions of Uranus and Neptune where magnetic fields can be amplified to considerable extents. Third, the transport of angular momentum due to magnetic and mechanical turbulent viscosities and the resultant redistribution of surface density in the nebula are investigated. The results show that the density redistribution occurs, in general, in a direction to attain a distribution of surface density which has nearly the same r-dependence as that obtained from the present distribution of the planetary mass. This redistribution seems to be possible if it occurs at a formation stage of the nebula where the presence of large viscosities is expected.

Models from 0.8 to 120 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> at solar metallicity (Z = 0.014)", "abstract_clean": "Aims: Many topical astrophysical research areas, such as the properties of planet host stars, the nature of the progenitors of different types of supernovae and gamma ray bursts, and the evolution of galaxies, require complete and homogeneous sets of stellar models at different metallicities in order to be studied during the whole of cosmic history. We present here a first set of models for solar metallicity, where the effects of rotation are accounted for in a homogeneous way. Methods: We computed a grid of 48 different stellar evolutionary tracks, both rotating and non-rotating, at Z = 0.014, spanning a wide mass range from 0.8 to 120 M⊙. For each of the stellar masses considered, electronic tables provide data for 400 stages along the evolutionary track and at each stage, a set of 43 physical data are given. These grids thus provide an extensive and detailed data basis for comparisons with the observations. The rotating models start on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) with a rotation rate υini/υcrit = 0.4. The evolution is computed until the end of the central carbon-burning phase, the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, or the core helium-flash for, respectively, the massive, intermediate, and both low and very low mass stars. The initial abundances are those deduced by Asplund and collaborators, which best fit the observed abundances of massive stars in the solar neighbourhood. We update both the opacities and nuclear reaction rates, and introduce new prescriptions for the mass-loss rates as stars approach the Eddington and/or the critical velocity. We account for both atomic diffusion and magnetic braking in our low-mass star models. Results: The present rotating models provide a good description of the average evolution of non-interacting stars. In particular, they reproduce the observed main-sequence width, the positions of the red giant and supergiant stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, the observed surface compositions and rotational velocities. Very interestingly, the enhancement of the mass loss during the red-supergiant stage, when the luminosity becomes supra-Eddington in some outer layers, help models above 15-20 M⊙ to lose a significant part of their hydrogen envelope and evolve back into the blue part of the HR diagram. This result has interesting consequences for the blue to red supergiant ratio, the minimum mass for stars to become Wolf-Rayet stars, and the maximum initial mass of stars that explode as type II-P supernovae.

These isochrones are derived from stellar models computed with the most recent radiative opacities by Iglesias et al. (1992). In addition to this we present another set with chemical composition [Z=0.001, Y=0.23] based on models calculated with the radiative opacities by Huebner et al. (1977). All the stellar models are followed from the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) to the central carbon ignition for massive stars or to the beginning of the thermally pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch phase (TP-AGB) for low and intermediate mass stars. For each isochrone, we give the current mass, effective temperatures, bolometric and visual magnitudes, (U-B), (B-V), (V-R), (V-I), (V-J), (V-H), and (V-K) colors, and the luminosity function for the case of the Salpeter law. In addition to this, integrated magnitudes and colors at several characteristic points are also presented together with the mass of the remnant star when appropriate. The main characteristic that makes this set of isochrones very valuable is based on their extension in mass and chemical composition, besides the calculation of late stages of evolution, beyond the red giant tip till the white dwarf stage after the planetary nebula phase.", "domain_category": "planetary_science", "spans": [{"surface": "theoretical", "start": 40, "end": 51, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.559}, {"surface": "isochrones", "start": 52, "end": 62, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4872}, {"surface": "most recent radiative opacities", "start": 316, "end": 347, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4673}, {"surface": "Ig", "start": 351, "end": 353, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.3764}, {"surface": "[Z=0.001, Y=0.23]", "start": 444, "end": 461, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3687}, {"surface": "the", "start": 494, "end": 497, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4728}, {"surface": "radiative opacities", "start": 498, "end": 517, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5439}, {"surface": "Huebner", "start": 521, "end": 528, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.56}, {"surface": "stellar models", "start": 552, "end": 566, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.337}, {"surface": "zero age main sequence (", "start": 589, "end": 613, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8655}, {"surface": "ZAMS) to", "start": 613, "end": 621, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7807}, {"surface": "the", "start": 622, "end": 625, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3696}, {"surface": "central carbon ignition", "start": 626, "end": 649, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8781}, {"surface": "massive stars or", "start": 654, "end": 670, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5786}, {"surface": "the", "start": 691, "end": 694, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4198}, {"surface": "thermally pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch phase (", "start": 695, "end": 758, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8311}, {"surface": "TP-AGB)", "start": 758, "end": 765, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6579}, {"surface": "low", "start": 770, "end": 773, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6206}, {"surface": "current mass", "start": 835, "end": 847, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8925}, {"surface": "effective temperatures", "start": 849, "end": 871, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8859}, {"surface": "bolometric and", "start": 873, "end": 887, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9348}, {"surface": "visual magnitudes", "start": 888, "end": 905, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.705}, {"surface": "(", "start": 907, "end": 908, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.612}, {"surface": "U-B)", "start": 908, "end": 912, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5734}, {"surface": "(", "start": 914, "end": 915, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.371}, {"surface": "B-V)", "start": 915, "end": 919, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5094}, {"surface": "(V-R)", "start": 921, "end": 926, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3975}, {"surface": "(V-I)", "start": 928, "end": 933, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4154}, {"surface": "(V-J)", "start": 935, "end": 940, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4064}, {"surface": "(V-H)", "start": 942, "end": 947, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4252}, {"surface": "(", "start": 953, "end": 954, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4869}, {"surface": "V-K) colors", "start": 954, "end": 965, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4467}, {"surface": "luminosity", "start": 975, "end": 985, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4087}, {"surface": "Salpeter law", "start": 1015, "end": 1027, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6674}, {"surface": "integrated magnitudes", "start": 1050, "end": 1071, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9182}, {"surface": "characteristic", "start": 1094, "end": 1108, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4398}, {"surface": "mass", "start": 1153, "end": 1157, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4284}, {"surface": "the", "start": 1161, "end": 1164, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6567}, {"surface": "remnant star", "start": 1165, "end": 1177, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7866}, {"surface": "isochrones", "start": 1243, "end": 1253, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6535}, {"surface": "late stages", "start": 1357, "end": 1368, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.43}, {"surface": "the", "start": 1390, "end": 1393, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3518}, {"surface": "red giant tip", "start": 1394, "end": 1407, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.873}, {"surface": "the", "start": 1413, "end": 1416, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3203}, {"surface": "white dwarf stage", "start": 1417, "end": 1434, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8696}, {"surface": "planetary nebula phase", "start": 1445, "end": 1467, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8717}]}

{"bibcode": "2008SSRv..136....5K", "title": "The STEREO Mission: An Introduction", "abstract_clean": "The twin STEREO spacecraft were launched on October 26, 2006, at 00:52 UT from Kennedy Space Center aboard a Delta 7925 launch vehicle. After a series of highly eccentric Earth orbits with apogees beyond the moon, each spacecraft used close flybys of the moon to escape into orbits about the Sun near 1 AU. Once in heliospheric orbit, one spacecraft trails Earth while the other leads. As viewed from the Sun, the two spacecraft separate at approximately 44 to 45 degrees per year. The purposes of the STEREO Mission are to understand the causes and mechanisms of coronal mass ejection (CME) initiation and to follow the propagation of CMEs through the inner heliosphere to Earth. Researchers will use STEREO measurements to study the mechanisms and sites of energetic particle acceleration and to develop three-dimensional (3-D) time-dependent models of the magnetic topology, temperature, density and velocity of the solar wind between the Sun and Earth. To accomplish these goals, each STEREO spacecraft is equipped with an almost identical set of optical, radio and in situ particles and fields instruments provided by U.S. and European investigators. The SECCHI suite of instruments includes two white light coronagraphs, an extreme ultraviolet imager and two heliospheric white light imagers which track CMEs out to 1 AU. The IMPACT suite of instruments measures in situ solar wind electrons, energetic electrons, protons and heavier ions. IMPACT also includes a magnetometer to measure the in situ magnetic field strength and direction. The PLASTIC instrument measures the composition of heavy ions in the ambient plasma as well as protons and alpha particles. The S/WAVES instrument uses radio waves to track the location of CME-driven shocks and the 3-D topology of open field lines along which flow particles produced by solar flares. Each of the four instrument packages produce a small real-time stream of selected data for purposes of predicting space weather events at Earth. NOAA forecasters at the Space Environment Center and others will use these data in their space weather forecasting and their resultant products will be widely used throughout the world. In addition to the four instrument teams, there is substantial participation by modeling and theory oriented teams. All STEREO data are freely available through individual Web sites at the four Principal Investigator institutions as well as at the STEREO Science Center located at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.",

Together with our previously published JHKL investigations of the younger NGC 2024, Trapezium, and IC 348 clusters, we have completed the first systematic and homogeneous survey for circumstellar disks in a sample of young clusters that both span a significant range in age (0.3-30 Myr) and contain statistically significant numbers of stars whose masses span nearly the entire stellar mass spectrum. Analysis of the combined survey indicates that the cluster disk fraction is initially very high (>=80%) and rapidly decreases with increasing cluster age, such that one-half the stars within the clusters lose their disks in <~3 Myr. Moreover, these observations yield an overall disk lifetime of ~6 Myr in the surveyed cluster sample. This is the timescale for essentially all the stars in a cluster to lose their disks.

Hopefully, we shall discern a level of complexity which is intuitively attractive and which optimizes computational speed and convenience without unduly sacrificing accuracy.Discussion is focused on density stratified flow due to temperature. However, other dependent variables-such as water vapor and droplet density-can be treated in analogous fashion. It is, in fact, the anticipation of additional physical complexity in modeling turbulent flow fields that partially motivates the interest in an organized process of analytical simplification.For the problem of a planetary boundary layer subject to a diurnally varying surface heat flux or surface temperature, three models of varying complexity have been integrated for 10 days. All of the models incorporate identical empirical constants obtained from neutral flow data alone. The most complex of the three models requires simultaneous solution of 10 partial differential equations for turbulence moments in addition to the equations for the mean velocity components and temperature; the least complex eliminates all of the 10 differential equation whereas a `compromise' model retains two differential equations for total turbulent energy and temperature variance.We conclude that all of the models give nearly the same results.

{"bibcode": "1999SSRv...90..413R", "title": "Particle acceleration at the Sun and in the heliosphere", "abstract_clean": "Energetic particles are accelerated in rich profusion at sites throughout the heliosphere. They come from solar flares in the low corona, from shock waves driven outward by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), from planetary magnetospheres and bow shocks. They come from corotating interaction regions (CIRs) produced by high-speed streams in the solar wind, and from the heliospheric termination shock at the outer edge of the heliospheric cavity. We sample many populations near Earth, but can distinguish them readily by their element and isotope abundances, ionization states, energy spectra, angular distributions and time behavior. Remote spacecraft have probed the spatial distributions of the particles and examined new sources in situ. Most acceleration sources can be ‘seen’ only by direct observation of the particles; few photons are produced at these sites.

Although, with one exception, complex molecules have only been detected in the gas phase, there is strong evidence that they can be formed in ice mantles on interstellar grains. The nature of the gaseous complex species depends dramatically on the source where they are found: in cold, dense regions they tend to be unsaturated (hydrogen-poor) and exotic, whereas in young stellar objects, they tend to be quite saturated (hydrogen-rich) and terrestrial in nature. Based on both their spectra and chemistry, complex molecules are excellent probes of the physical conditions and history of the sources where they reside. Because they are detected in young stellar objects, complex molecules are expected to be common ingredients for new planetary systems.

{"bibcode": "2005ApJ...622.1102F", "title": "The Planet-Metallicity Correlation", "abstract_clean": "We have recently carried out spectral synthesis modeling to determine Teff, logg, vsini, and [Fe/H] for 1040 FGK-type stars on the Keck, Lick, and Anglo-Australian Telescope planet search programs. This is the first time that a single, uniform spectroscopic analysis has been made for every star on a large Doppler planet search survey. We identify a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes K>30 m s-1 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars, we determine that fewer than 3% of stars with -0.5<[Fe/H]<0.0 have Doppler-detected planets. Above solar metallicity, there is a smooth and rapid rise in the fraction of stars with planets. At [Fe/H]>+0.3 dex, 25% of observed stars have detected gas giant planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.

The basic instrument of the Magnetic Field Investigation (MFI) is a boom-mounted dual triaxial fluxgate magnetometer and associated electronics. The dual configuration provides redundancy and also permits accurate removal of the dipolar portion of the spacecraft magnetic field. The instrument provides (1) near real-time data at nominally one vector per 92 s as key parameter data for broad dissemination, (2) rapid data at 10.9 vectors s-1 for standard analysis, and (3) occasionally, snapshot (SS) memory data and Fast Fourier Transform data (FFT), both based on 44 vectors s-1. These measurements will be precise (0.025%), accurate, ultra-sensitive (0.008 nT/step quantization), and where the sensor noise level is <0.006 nT r.m.s. for 0 10 Hz. The digital processing unit utilizes a 12-bit microprocessor controlled analogue-to-digital converter. The instrument features a very wide dynamic range of measurement capability, from ±4 nT up to ±65 536 nT per axis in eight discrete ranges. (The upper range permits complete testing in the Earth's field.) In the FTT mode power spectral density elements are transmitted to the ground as fast as once every 23 s (high rate), and 2.7 min of SS memory time series data, triggered automatically by pre-set command, requires typically about 5.1 hours for transmission. Standard data products are expected to be the following vector field averages: 0.0227-s (detail data from SS), 0.092 s (‘detail’ in standard mode), 3 s, 1 min, and 1 hour, in both GSE and GSM coordinates, as well as the FFT spectral elements. As has been our team's tradition, high instrument reliability is obtained by the use of fully redundant systems and extremely conservative designs. We plan studies of the solar wind: (1) as a collisionless plasma laboratory, at all time scales, macro, meso and micro, but concentrating on the kinetic scale, the highest time resolution of the instrument (=0.022 s), (2) as a consequence of solar energy and mass output, (3) as an external source of plasma that can couple mass, momentum, and energy to the Earth's magnetosphere, and (4) as it is modified as a consequence of its imbedded field interacting with the moon.

We have identified 95 detached binary systems containing 190 stars (94 eclipsing systems, and α Centauri) that satisfy our criterion that the mass and radius of both stars be known within errors of ±3% accuracy or better. All of them are non-interacting systems, and so the stars should have evolved as if they were single. This sample more than doubles that of the earlier similar review by Andersen (Astron Astrophys Rev 3:91-126, 1991), extends the mass range at both ends and, for the first time, includes an extragalactic binary. In every case, we have examined the original data and recomputed the stellar parameters with a consistent set of assumptions and physical constants. To these we add interstellar reddening, effective temperature, metal abundance, rotational velocity and apsidal motion determinations when available, and we compute a number of other physical parameters, notably luminosity and distance. These accurate physical parameters reveal the effects of stellar evolution with unprecedented clarity, and we discuss the use of the data in observational tests of stellar evolution models in some detail. Earlier findings of significant structural differences between moderately fast-rotating, mildly active stars and single stars, ascribed to the presence of strong magnetic and spot activity, are confirmed beyond doubt. We also show how the best data can be used to test prescriptions for the subtle interplay between convection, diffusion, and other non-classical effects in stellar models. The amount and quality of the data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the systems in considerable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational synchronisation and orbital circularisation in greater detail than possible before. We show that the formulae for pseudo-synchronisation of stars in eccentric orbits predict the observed rotations quite well, except for very young and/or widely separated stars. Deviations do occur, however, especially for stars with convective envelopes. The superior data set finally demonstrates that apsidal motion rates as predicted from General Relativity plus tidal theory are in good agreement with the best observational data. No reliable binary data exist, which challenge General Relativity to any significant extent. The new data also enable us to derive empirical calibrations of M and R for single (post-) main-sequence stars above {0.6 M_{odot}}. Simple, polynomial functions of T eff, log g and [Fe/H] yield M and R within errors of 6 and 3%, respectively. Excellent agreement is found with independent determinations for host stars of transiting extrasolar planets, and good agreement with determinations of M and R from stellar models as constrained by trigonometric parallaxes and spectroscopic values of T eff and [Fe/H]. Finally, we list a set of 23 interferometric binaries with masses known to be better than 3%, but without fundamental radius determinations (except α Aur).

{"bibcode": "1993RvMP...65..851C", "title": "Pattern formation outside of equilibrium", "abstract_clean": "A comprehensive review of spatiotemporal pattern formation in systems driven away from equilibrium is presented, with emphasis on comparisons between theory and quantitative experiments. Examples include patterns in hydrodynamic systems such as thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures, Taylor-Couette flow, parametric-wave instabilities, as well as patterns in solidification fronts, nonlinear optics, oscillatory chemical reactions and excitable biological media. The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times. A unified description is developed, based on the linear instabilities of a homogeneous state, which leads naturally to a classification of patterns in terms of the characteristic wave vector q0 and frequency ω0 of the instability. Type Is systems (ω0=0, q0≠0) are stationary in time and periodic in space; type IIIo systems (ω0≠0, q0=0) are periodic in time and uniform in space; and type Io systems (ω0≠0, q0≠0) are periodic in both space and time. Near a continuous (or supercritical) instability, the dynamics may be accurately described via \"amplitude equations,\" whose form is universal for each type of instability. The specifics of each system enter only through the nonuniversal coefficients. Far from the instability threshold a different universal description known as the \"phase equation\" may be derived, but it is restricted to slow distortions of an ideal pattern. For many systems appropriate starting equations are either not known or too complicated to analyze conveniently. It is thus useful to introduce phenomenological order-parameter models, which lead to the correct amplitude equations near threshold, and which may be solved analytically or numerically in the nonlinear regime away from the instability. The above theoretical methods are useful in analyzing \"real pattern effects\" such as the influence of external boundaries, or the formation and dynamics of defects in ideal structures. An important element in nonequilibrium systems is the appearance of deterministic chaos. A greal deal is known about systems with a small number of degrees of freedom displaying \"temporal chaos,\" where the structure of the phase space can be analyzed in detail. For spatially extended systems with many degrees of freedom, on the other hand, one is dealing with spatiotemporal chaos and appropriate methods of analysis need to be developed. In addition to the general features of nonequilibrium pattern formation discussed above, detailed reviews of theoretical and experimental work on many specific systems are presented. These include Rayleigh-Bénard convection in a pure fluid, convection in binary-fluid mixtures, electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals, Taylor-Couette flow between rotating cylinders, parametric surface waves, patterns in certain open flow systems, oscillatory chemical reactions, static and dynamic patterns in biological media, crystallization fronts, and patterns in nonlinear optics.

{"bibcode": "2013Ecogr..36...27D", "title": "Collinearity: a review of methods to deal with it and a simulation study evaluating their performance", "abstract_clean": "Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection.

Small Amplitude Processes in Charged and Neutral One-Component Systems", "abstract_clean": "A kinetic theory approach to collision processes in ionized and neutral gases is presented. This approach is adequate for the unified treatment of the dynamic properties of gases over a continuous range of pressures from the Knudsen limit to the high-pressure limit where the aerodynamic equations are valid. It is also possible to satisfy the correct microscopic boundary conditions. The method consists in altering the collision terms in the Boltzmann equation. The modified collision terms are constructed so that each collision conserves particle number, momentum, and energy; other characteristics such as persistence of velocities and angular dependence may be included. The present article illustrates the technique for a simple model involving the assumption of a collision time independent of velocity; this model is applied to the study of small amplitude oscillations of one-component ionized and neutral gases. The initial value problem for unbounded space is solved by performing a Fourier transformation on the space variables and a Laplace transformation on the time variable. For uncharged gases there results the correct adiabatic limiting law for sound-wave propagation at high pressures and, in addition, one obtains a theory of absorption and dispersion of sound for arbitrary pressures. For ionized gases the difference in the nature of the organization in the low-pressure plasma oscillations and in high-pressure sound-type oscillations is studied. Two important cases are distinguished. If the wavelengths of the oscillations are long compared to either the Debye length or the mean free path, a small change in frequency is obtained as the collision frequency varies from zero to infinity. The accompanying absorption is small; it reaches its maximum value when the collision frequency equals the plasma frequency. The second case refers to waves shorter than both the Debye length and the mean free path; these waves are characterized by a very heavy absorption.", "domain_category": "multidisciplinary", "spans": [{"surface": "kinetic", "start": 2, "end": 9, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5142}, {"surface": "collision processes", "start": 29, "end": 48, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9869}, {"surface": "ionized", "start": 52, "end": 59, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.886}, {"surface": "dynamic properties", "start": 151, "end": 169, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7616}, {"surface": "gases", "start": 173, "end": 178, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8805}, {"surface": "the", "start": 221, "end": 224, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.4161}, {"surface": "Knudsen limit", "start": 225, "end": 238, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.4487}, {"surface": "aerodynamic equations", "start": 276, "end": 297, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7275}, {"surface": "microscopic", "start": 352, "end": 363, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6574}, {"surface": "collision", "start": 421, "end": 430, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7241}, {"surface": "Boltzmann", "start": 444, "end": 453, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8315}, {"surface": "collision", "start": 477, "end": 486, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5846}, {"surface": "particle number", "start": 542, "end": 557, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7279}, {"surface": "persistence of velocities", "start": 611, "end": 636, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6171}, {"surface": "angular dependence", "start": 641, "end": 659, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7756}, {"surface": "collision time independent", "start": 772, "end": 798, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7456}, {"surface": "velocity", "start": 802, "end": 810, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6947}, {"surface": "small amplitude oscillations", "start": 850, "end": 878, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9632}, {"surface": "one-component", "start": 882, "end": 895, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9101}, {"surface": "ionized and neutral gases", "start": 896, "end": 921, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4506}, {"surface": "unbounded space", "start": 953, "end": 968, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6975}, {"surface": "uncharged gases", "start": 1096, "end": 1111, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6631}, {"surface": "adiabatic", "start": 1138, "end": 1147, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7875}, {"surface": "sound-wave propagation", "start": 1165, "end": 1187, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9841}, {"surface": "absorption", "start": 1248, "end": 1258, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8897}, {"surface": "dispersion of", "start": 1263, "end": 1276, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9276}, {"surface": "sound", "start": 1277, "end": 1282, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8506}, {"surface": "ionized gases", "start": 1312, "end": 1325, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8136}, {"surface": "the organization", "start": 1358, "end": 1374, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.962}, {"surface": "low-pressure plasma oscillations", "start": 1382, "end": 1414, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6531}, {"surface": "high-pressure", "start": 1422, "end": 1435, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.67}, {"surface": "sound-type oscillations", "start": 1436, "end": 1459, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7158}, {"surface": "the oscillations", "start": 1533, "end": 1549, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5185}, {"surface": "Debye length", "start": 1582, "end": 1594, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7272}, {"surface": "mean free path", "start": 1602, "end": 1616, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5544}, {"surface": "plasma frequency", "start": 1822, "end": 1838, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4587}, {"surface": "Debye length", "start": 1894, "end": 1906, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7543}, {"surface": "mean free path", "start": 1915, "end": 1929, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5807}]}

A fundamental constraint in manipulating light is the extremely low transmittivity of apertures smaller than the wavelength of the incident photon. While exploring the optical properties of submicrometre cylindrical cavities in metallic films, we have found that arrays of such holes display highly unusual zero-order transmission spectra (where the incident and detected light are collinear) at wavelengths larger than the array period, beyond which no diffraction occurs. In particular, sharp peaks in transmission are observed at wavelengths as large as ten times the diameter of the cylinders. At these maxima the transmission efficiency can exceed unity (when normalized to the area of the holes), which is orders of magnitude greater than predicted by standard aperture theory. Our experiments provide evidence that these unusual optical properties are due to the coupling of light with plasmons - electronic excitations - on the surface of the periodically patterned metal film.

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.

Fifty years after Kramers' seminal paper on thermally activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases. The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted with Kramers' reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers' work for weakly damped systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented, together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest quantum versions of Kramers' theory are discussed, thereby providing a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work as it relates to Kramers' reaction-rate theory and to indicate the most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.", "domain_category": "multidisciplinary", "spans": [{"surface": "rate coefficients", "start": 19, "end": 36, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9916}, {"surface": "Kramers", "start": 163, "end": 170, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8002}, {"surface": "thermally activated barrier crossing", "start": 189, "end": 225, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9903}, {"surface": "noise-activated escape", "start": 327, "end": 349, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9906}, {"surface": "single-", "start": 537, "end": 544, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8909}, {"surface": "many-dimensional metastable systems (including", "start": 549, "end": 595, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6705}, {"surface": "fields)", "start": 596, "end": 603, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9304}, {"surface": "gases", "start": 607, "end": 612, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4165}, {"surface": "many-dimensional transition-state theory", "start": 647, "end": 687, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9852}, {"surface": "Kramers' reaction-rate theory", "start": 707, "end": 736, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9084}, {"surface": "moderate-to-strong friction", "start": 741, "end": 768, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9136}, {"surface": "unimolecular rate theory", "start": 848, "end": 872, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9923}, {"surface": "Kramers' work", "start": 877, "end": 890, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9344}, {"surface": "weakly damped systems", "start": 895, "end": 916, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8134}, {"surface": "rate", "start": 922, "end": 926, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6688}, {"surface": "memory friction", "start": 949, "end": 964, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9837}, {"surface": "weak-to-", "start": 1058, "end": 1066, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9541}, {"surface": "moderate-to-strong friction", "start": 1066, "end": 1093, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5042}, {"surface": "turnover theory", "start": 1113, "end": 1128, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8505}, {"surface": "noise-activated escape", "start": 1152, "end": 1174, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9918}, {"surface": "metastable potential configurations", "start": 1212, "end": 1247, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.859}, {"surface": "mean-", "start": 1278, "end": 1283, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.946}, {"surface": "first-passage-time", "start": 1283, "end": 1301, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4796}, {"surface": "escape", "start": 1354, "end": 1360, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9864}, {"surface": "driven systems", "start": 1364, "end": 1378, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8684}, {"surface": "metastable stationary nonequilibrium states", "start": 1409, "end": 1452, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.403}, {"surface": "Kramers' theory", "start": 1626, "end": 1641, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9574}, {"surface": "dissipative", "start": 1692, "end": 1703, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9805}, {"surface": "escape events", "start": 1704, "end": 1717, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5544}, {"surface": "Kramers'", "start": 1827, "end": 1835, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9419}, {"surface": "reaction-rate theory", "start": 1836, "end": 1856, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4596}]}

{"bibcode": "2013MEcEv...4..133N", "title": "A general and simple method for obtaining R<SUP>2</SUP> from generalized linear mixed-effects models", "abstract_clean": "Summary The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of 'variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.", "domain_category": "multidisciplinary", "spans": [{"surface": "both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models", "start": 19, "end": 74, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9641}, {"surface": "LMMs", "start": 76, "end": 80, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6032}, {"surface": "ecology", "start": 212, "end": 219, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3233}, {"surface": "Information criteria", "start": 235, "end": 255, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6077}, {"surface": "Akaike Information Criterion", "start": 265, "end": 293, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5802}, {"surface": "AIC)", "start": 295, "end": 299, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6846}, {"surface": "mixed-effects models", "start": 353, "end": 373, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8084}, {"surface": "'", "start": 395, "end": 396, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.633}, {"surface": "variance explained'", "start": 396, "end": 415, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8004}, {"surface": "R2", "start": 417, "end": 419, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5915}, {"surface": "relevant", "start": 426, "end": 434, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4789}, {"surface": "summarizing", "start": 435, "end": 446, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5112}, {"surface": "mixed-effects models", "start": 460, "end": 480, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8927}, {"surface": "R2", "start": 512, "end": 514, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5785}, {"surface": "linear models (", "start": 541, "end": 556, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8261}, {"surface": "LMs)", "start": 556, "end": 560, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.526}, {"surface": "GLMs)", "start": 597, "end": 602, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3969}, {"surface": "R2", "start": 604, "end": 606, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6141}, {"surface": "summary", "start": 764, "end": 771, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6615}, {"surface": "R2", "start": 831, "end": 833, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5943}, {"surface": "R2", "start": 922, "end": 924, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8384}, {"surface": "mixed-effects models", "start": 929, "end": 949, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8632}, {"surface": "R2", "start": 972, "end": 974, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7067}, {"surface": "R2", "start": 1044, "end": 1046, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8347}, {"surface": "mixed-effects", "start": 1051, "end": 1064, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9029}, {"surface": "decreased", "start": 1097, "end": 1106, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4896}, {"surface": "negative", "start": 1110, "end": 1118, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3724}, {"surface": "R2 values", "start": 1119, "end": 1128, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5496}, {"surface": "larger models", "start": 1132, "end": 1145, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6718}, {"surface": "R2", "start": 1278, "end": 1280, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.802}, {"surface": "mixed-effects models", "start": 1285, "end": 1305, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8795}, {"surface": "R2", "start": 1350, "end": 1352, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8119}, {"surface": "LMs", "start": 1357, "end": 1360, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8092}, {"surface": "GLMs", "start": 1365, "end": 1369, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4024}, {"surface": "R2", "start": 1427, "end": 1429, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7456}, {"surface": "mixed-effects models", "start": 1434, "end": 1454, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8621}, {"surface": "R2", "start": 1531, "end": 1533, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6882}, {"surface": "marginal", "start": 1535, "end": 1543, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9434}, {"surface": "conditional R2", "start": 1548, "end": 1562, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9141}, {"surface": "LMMs", "start": 1573, "end": 1577, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8673}, {"surface": "GLMMs", "start": 1582, "end": 1587, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.775}, {"surface": "mixed-effects models", "start": 1793, "end": 1813, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8434}, {"surface": "R2", "start": 1887, "end": 1889, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8077}]}

Our previous paper [M.C. Biesinger et al., Appl. Surf. Sci. 257 (2010) 887-898.] in which we examined Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn species, has shown that all the values of the spectral fitting parameters for each specific species, i.e. binding energy (eV), full wide at half maximum (FWHM) value (eV) for each pass energy, spin-orbit splitting values and asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, are not all normally provided in the literature and data bases, and are necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis. A more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve fitting was developed based on a combination of (1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, (2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and/or a compilation of literature references and (3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available. This paper extends this approach to the chemical states of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni metals, and various oxides and hydroxides where intense, complex multiplet splitting in many of the chemical states of these elements poses unique difficulties for chemical state analysis. The curve fitting procedures proposed use the same criteria as proposed previously but with the additional complexity of fitting of multiplet split spectra which has been done based on spectra of numerous reference materials and theoretical XPS modeling of these transition metal species. Binding energies, FWHM values, asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, multiplet peak separation and peak area percentages are presented.

{"bibcode": "2004ChGeo.211...47J", "title": "The application of laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to in situ U-Pb zircon geochronology", "abstract_clean": "This paper reports new developments in in situ U-Pb zircon geochronology using 266 and 213 nm laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Standard spot ablation (spot diameters 40-80 μm) was employed, with no sampling strategies employed specifically to minimise elemental fractionation. Instead, He ablation gas and carefully replicated ablation conditions were employed to maintain constant ablation-related elemental fractionation of Pb and U between analyses. Combining these strategies with calibration on a new zircon standard (GJ-1) allows elemental fractionation and instrumental mass bias to be corrected efficiently, and accurate 206Pb/ 238U and 207Pb/ 235U ratios to be measured with short-term precision (2 r.s.d.) of 1.9% and 3.0%, respectively. Long-term precision (2 r.s.d.) of the technique (266 nm ablation), based on 355 analyses of the 91500 zircon (1065 Ma) standard over more than a year, was 3.8%, 4.0% and 1.4% for the 206Pb/ 238U, 207Pb/ 235U and 207Pb/ 206Pb ratios, respectively. Long-term precision (2 r.s.d.) for the 206Pb/ 238U, 207Pb/ 235U and 207Pb/ 206Pb ratios of the Mud Tank zircon (732 Ma) was 3.9%, 4.1% and 1.7%, respectively (359 analyses). Selective integration of time-resolved signals was used to minimise the effect of Pb loss and common Pb enrichments on the measured ages. The precision and accuracy of our data compare very favourably with those obtained using more involved procedures to correct or minimise ablation- and ICP-MS-induced biases. 213 nm laser ablation produced comparable precision to 266 nm ablation using generally smaller spot sizes (40-50 vs. 60-80 μm), and offered significant advantages in terms of ablation duration and stability, particularly for small zircons (<60 μm). For the 91500 zircon, but not the Mud Tank zircon, 213 nm ablation also produced significantly older and more accurate Pb/U ages. This suggests that shorter wavelength ablation may have reduced a matrix-dependent elemental fractionation difference between sample and standard. The accuracy and precision of the technique for young zircons are demonstrated by analysis of three zircon populations ranging in age from 417 to 7 Ma. In each case, the zircons have yielded concordant ages or common Pb discordia which give concordia intercept ages that are in agreement with independently determined ages for the same samples.

The high photoconversion efficiencies of these systems stem from the comparable optical absorption length and charge-carrier diffusion lengths, transcending the traditional constraints of solution-processed semiconductors.", "domain_category": "multidisciplinary", "spans": [{"surface": "solution-processed photovoltaics", "start": 16, "end": 48, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8335}, {"surface": "exciton or", "start": 94, "end": 104, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8912}, {"surface": "electron-hole diffusion lengths", "start": 105, "end": 136, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8142}, {"surface": "CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells", "start": 205, "end": 233, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9479}, {"surface": "photophysical mechanisms", "start": 327, "end": 351, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7102}, {"surface": "this perovskite", "start": 454, "end": 469, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6275}, {"surface": "selective-electron", "start": 482, "end": 500, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9614}, {"surface": "selective-hole extraction materials", "start": 504, "end": 539, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.953}, {"surface": "balanced", "start": 580, "end": 588, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.896}, {"surface": "long-range", "start": 589, "end": 599, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8132}, {"surface": "electron-hole diffusion lengths", "start": 600, "end": 631, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7693}, {"surface": "solution-processed", "start": 662, "end": 680, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9121}, {"surface": "CH3NH3PbI3", "start": 681, "end": 691, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8748}, {"surface": "optical absorption length", "start": 773, "end": 798, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9398}, {"surface": "charge-carrier diffusion lengths", "start": 803, "end": 835, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8613}, {"surface": "solution-processed semiconductors", "start": 881, "end": 914, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9068}]}

This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream communities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjustments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a framework for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Implications of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are discussed.Key words: river continuum; stream ecosystems; ecosystem structure, function; resource partitioning; ecosystem stability; community succession; river zonation; stream geomorphology", "domain_category": "multidisciplinary", "spans": [{"surface": "headwaters", "start": 5, "end": 15, "type": "entity", "confidence": 0.618}, {"surface": "mouth", "start": 19, "end": 24, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4907}, {"surface": "physical variables", "start": 30, "end": 48, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3972}, {"surface": "river system", "start": 58, "end": 70, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3924}, {"surface": "physical conditions", "start": 104, "end": 123, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5011}, {"surface": "biotic adjustments", "start": 238, "end": 256, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6265}, {"surface": "loading, transport, utilization", "start": 284, "end": 315, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6369}, {"surface": "organic matter", "start": 332, "end": 346, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7029}, {"surface": "energy equilibrium", "start": 389, "end": 407, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8089}, {"surface": "fluvial geomorphologists", "start": 418, "end": 442, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.692}, {"surface": "structural", "start": 468, "end": 478, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5526}, {"surface": "stream communities", "start": 513, "end": 531, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.949}, {"surface": "mean", "start": 588, "end": 592, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5491}, {"surface": "producer and", "start": 638, "end": 650, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9329}, {"surface": "consumer communities", "start": 651, "end": 671, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8052}, {"surface": "river reach", "start": 698, "end": 709, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4864}, {"surface": "biological communities", "start": 820, "end": 842, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9303}, {"surface": "synchronized species replacements", "start": 899, "end": 932, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8749}, {"surface": "continuous", "start": 939, "end": 949, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5035}, {"surface": "energy inputs", "start": 1005, "end": 1018, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6978}, {"surface": "biological", "start": 1040, "end": 1050, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4613}, {"surface": "energy inputs", "start": 1122, "end": 1135, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6148}, {"surface": "food, substrate", "start": 1167, "end": 1182, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4576}, {"surface": "energy processing", "start": 1237, "end": 1254, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.709}, {"surface": "biological communities", "start": 1293, "end": 1315, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9368}, {"surface": "natural streams", "start": 1329, "end": 1344, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5658}, {"surface": "processing strategies", "start": 1352, "end": 1373, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6889}, {"surface": "minimum energy loss", "start": 1384, "end": 1403, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7371}, {"surface": "Downstream communities", "start": 1405, "end": 1427, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7554}, {"surface": "upstream processing inefficiencies", "start": 1459, "end": 1493, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5311}, {"surface": "upstream inefficiency (", "start": 1504, "end": 1527, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4402}, {"surface": "leakage)", "start": 1527, "end": 1535, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5987}, {"surface": "River Continuum", "start": 1606, "end": 1621, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8891}, {"surface": "lotic systems", "start": 1717, "end": 1730, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7634}, {"surface": "riverine ecosystems", "start": 1814, "end": 1833, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8387}, {"surface": "river continuum", "start": 1859, "end": 1874, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9522}, {"surface": "stream ecosystems", "start": 1876, "end": 1893, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6617}, {"surface": "river zonation", "start": 1992, "end": 2006, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8732}]}

{"bibcode": "1952RSPTB.237...37T", "title": "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis", "abstract_clean": "It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry.

It is a first-of-its-kind autonomous rapid-slewing satellite for transient astronomy and pioneers the way for future rapid-reaction and multiwavelength missions. It will be far more powerful than any previous GRB mission, observing more than 100 bursts yr-1 and performing detailed X-ray and UV/optical afterglow observations spanning timescales from 1 minute to several days after the burst. The objectives are to (1) determine the origin of GRBs, (2) classify GRBs and search for new types, (3) study the interaction of the ultrarelativistic outflows of GRBs with their surrounding medium, and (4) use GRBs to study the early universe out to z>10. The mission is being developed by a NASA-led international collaboration. It will carry three instruments: a new-generation wide-field gamma-ray (15-150 keV) detector that will detect bursts, calculate 1'-4' positions, and trigger autonomous spacecraft slews; a narrow-field X-ray telescope that will give 5\" positions and perform spectroscopy in the 0.2-10 keV band; and a narrow-field UV/optical telescope that will operate in the 170-600 nm band and provide 0.3\" positions and optical finding charts. Redshift determinations will be made for most bursts. In addition to the primary GRB science, the mission will perform a hard X-ray survey to a sensitivity of ~1 mcrab (~2×10-11 ergs cm-2 s-1 in the 15-150 keV band), more than an order of magnitude better than HEAO 1 A-4. A flexible data and operations system will allow rapid follow-up observations of all types of high-energy transients, with rapid data downlink and uplink available through the NASA TDRSS system. Swift transient data will be rapidly distributed to the astronomical community, and all interested observers are encouraged to participate in follow-up measurements. A Guest Investigator program for the mission will provide funding for community involvement. Innovations from the Swift program applicable to the future include (1) a large-area gamma-ray detector using the new CdZnTe detectors, (2) an autonomous rapid-slewing spacecraft, (3) a multiwavelength payload combining optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray instruments, (4) an observing program coordinated with other ground-based and space-based observatories, and (5) immediate multiwavelength data flow to the community.

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics.

This paper starts with a summary of the wide variety of technical fields where TiO 2 is of importance. The bulk structure and bulk defects (as far as relevant to the surface properties) are briefly reviewed. Rules to predict stable oxide surfaces are exemplified on rutile (1 1 0). The surface structure of rutile (1 1 0) is discussed in some detail. Theoretically predicted and experimentally determined relaxations of surface geometries are compared, and defects (step edge orientations, point and line defects, impurities, surface manifestations of crystallographic shear planes—CSPs) are discussed, as well as the image contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The controversy about the correct model for the (1×2) reconstruction appears to be settled. Different surface preparation methods, such as reoxidation of reduced crystals, can cause a drastic effect on surface geometries and morphology, and recommendations for preparing different TiO 2(1 1 0) surfaces are given. The structure of the TiO 2(1 0 0)-(1×1) surface is discussed and the proposed models for the (1×3) reconstruction are critically reviewed. Very recent results on anatase (1 0 0) and (1 0 1) surfaces are included. The electronic structure of stoichiometric TiO 2 surfaces is now well understood. Surface defects can be detected with a variety of surface spectroscopies. The vibrational structure is dominated by strong Fuchs-Kliewer phonons, and high-resolution electron energy loss spectra often need to be deconvoluted in order to render useful information about adsorbed molecules. The growth of metals (Li, Na, K, Cs, Ca, Al, Ti, V, Nb, Cr, Mo, Mn, Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au) as well as some metal oxides on TiO 2 is reviewed. The tendency to 'wet' the overlayer, the growth morphology, the epitaxial relationship, and the strength of the interfacial oxidation/reduction reaction all follow clear trends across the periodic table, with the reactivity of the overlayer metal towards oxygen being the most decisive factor. Alkali atoms form ordered superstructures at low coverages. Recent progress in understanding the surface structure of metals in the 'strong-metal support interaction' (SMSI) state is summarized. Literature is reviewed on the adsorption and reaction of a wide variety of inorganic molecules (H 2, O 2, H 2O, CO, CO 2, N 2, NH 3, NO x, sulfur- and halogen-containing molecules, rare gases) as well as organic molecules (carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, alkynes, pyridine and its derivates, silanes, methyl halides). The application of TiO 2-based systems in photo-active devices is discussed, and the results on UHV-based photocatalytic studies are summarized. The review ends with a brief conclusion and outlook of TiO 2-based surface science for the future.", "domain_category": "multidisciplinary", "spans": [{"surface": "single-crystalline system", "start":

Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.", "domain_category": "multidisciplinary", "spans": [{"surface": "Power-law distributions", "start": 0, "end": 23, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9308}, {"surface": "natural and man-made phenomena", "start": 131, "end": 161, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8786}, {"surface": "power laws", "start": 216, "end": 226, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9608}, {"surface": "tail", "start": 286, "end": 290, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4074}, {"surface": "large but rare events", "start": 356, "end": 377, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5855}, {"surface": "power-law behavior", "start": 439, "end": 457, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9052}, {"surface": "power-law data", "start": 501, "end": 515, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9285}, {"surface": "power-law distributions", "start": 613, "end": 636, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8984}, {"surface": "power law", "start": 788, "end": 797, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5826}, {"surface": "power-law behavior", "start": 888, "end": 906, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9487}, {"surface": "Kolmogorov", "start": 1023, "end": 1033, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4958}, {"surface": "power-law distribution", "start": 1361, "end": 1383, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8312}]}

These materials are increasingly being used for commercial purposes such as fillers, opacifiers, catalysts, semiconductors, cosmetics, microelectronics, and drug carriers. Materials in this size range may approach the length scale at which some specific physical or chemical interactions with their environment can occur. As a result, their properties differ substantially from those bulk materials of the same composition, allowing them to perform exceptional feats of conductivity, reactivity, and optical sensitivity. Possible undesirable results of these capabilities are harmful interactions with biological systems and the environment, with the potential to generate toxicity. The establishment of principles and test procedures to ensure safe manufacture and use of nanomaterials in the marketplace is urgently required and achievable.", "domain_category": "multidisciplinary", "spans": [{"surface": "conductivity", "start": 565, "end": 577, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7262}, {"surface": "reactivity", "start": 579, "end": 589, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4137}]}

We derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar masses using new techniques that make use of the latest stellar evolutionary synthesis and photoionization models. We find a tight (+/-0.1 dex) correlation between stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity. The relation is relatively steep from 108.5 to 1010.5 Msolar h-270, in good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 1010.5 Msolar. We use indirect estimates of the gas mass based on the Hα luminosity to compare our data to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. We show that metal loss is strongly anticorrelated with baryonic mass, with low-mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal depleted than L* galaxies at z~0.1. Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies but is found in galaxies with masses as high as 1010 Msolar. We interpret this as strong evidence of both the ubiquity of galactic winds and their effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells.", "domain_category": "multidisciplinary", "spans": [{"surface": "Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging", "start": 11, "end": 43, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8555}, {"surface": "~53,000 star-forming galaxies", "start": 64, "end": 93, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5588}, {"surface": "stellar mass", "start": 133, "end": 145, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9593}, {"surface": "gas-phase metallicity", "start": 150, "end": 171, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9576}, {"surface": "gas-phase oxygen abundances", "start": 183, "end": 210, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.984}, {"surface": "stellar masses", "start": 215, "end": 229, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7316}, {"surface": "photoionization", "start": 314, "end": 329, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.5224}, {"surface": "stellar mass", "start": 387, "end": 399, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9445}, {"surface": "metallicity", "start": 404, "end": 415, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8408}, {"surface": "108.5", "start": 541, "end": 546, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7687}, {"surface": "luminosity", "start": 612, "end": 622, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8722}, {"surface": "metallicity", "start": 627, "end": 638, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.448}, {"surface": "1010.5", "start": 659, "end": 665, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.3867}, {"surface": "Msolar", "start": 666, "end": 672, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.354}, {"surface": "the", "start": 703, "end": 706, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9404}, {"surface": "gas mass", "start": 707, "end": 715, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.4938}, {"surface": "Hα luminosity", "start": 729, "end": 742, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7286}, {"surface": "metal loss", "start": 841, "end": 851, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9775}, {"surface": "baryonic mass", "start": 884, "end": 897, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.98}, {"surface": "low-mass", "start": 904, "end": 912, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.8941}, {"surface": "dwarf galaxies", "start": 913, "end": 927, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.6418}, {"surface": "metal depleted", "start": 947, "end": 961, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9086}, {"surface": "L* galaxies", "start": 967, "end": 978, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9678}, {"surface": "metal depletion", "start": 1002, "end": 1017, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9831}, {"surface": "dwarf galaxies", "start": 1037, "end": 1051, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.907}, {"surface": "galactic winds", "start": 1174, "end": 1188, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9948}, {"surface": "metals", "start": 1225, "end": 1231, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.7437}, {"surface": "galaxy potential wells", "start": 1237, "end": 1259, "type": "topic", "confidence": 0.9804}]}
