The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5M<SUB>solar</SUB> and near 0.08M<SUB>solar</SUB>. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices α are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by Δα~0.5 between 0.1 and 1M<SUB>solar</SUB> than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto &amp; Zoccali; Paresce &amp; De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; Méndez &amp; Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population.

New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r < 0.13 (95% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to \\Omega _k = -0.0027^{+ 0.0039}_{- 0.0038}; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to ∑m ν < 0.44 eV (95% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N eff = 3.84 ± 0.40, when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.", "database": ["astronomy"], "keywords": ["cosmic background radiation", "cosmology: observations", "dark matter", "early universe", "instrumentation: detectors", "space vehicles", "space vehicles: instruments", "telescopes", "Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"], "year": "2013", "doctype": "article", "citation_count": 5495, "domain_category": "astronomy", "spans": [{"surface": "based on", "start": 46, "end": 54, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaMath/basedOn", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "Microwave", "start": 85, "end": 94, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/SPECTRAL/ENGINEERING/MICROWAVE", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "Anisotropy", "start": 95, "end": 105, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/ATMOSPHERE/ATMOSPHERIC_RADIATION/ANISOTROPY", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "Probe", "start": 106, "end": 111, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1545", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "conjunction", "start": 128, "end": 139, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:295", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "sets", "start": 186, "end": 190, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:03zdc1b30", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "cosmic microwave background", "start": 359, "end": 386, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:322", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "anisotropy", "start": 387, "end": 397, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/ATMOSPHERE/ATMOSPHERIC_RADIATION/ANISOTROPY", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "oscillation", "start": 419, "end": 430, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:phenSystem/Oscillation", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "Hubble constant", "start": 446, "end": 461, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:758", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "first", "start": 730, "end": 735, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:016dza536", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "detection", "start": 736, "end": 745, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1911", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "based on", "start": 754, "end": 762, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaMath/basedOn", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "end of", "start": 795, "end": 801, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaTime/endOf", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "Omega", "start": 1277, "end": 1282, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01mbkbh33", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "helium abundance", "start": 1552, "end": 1568, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:713", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "big bang nucleosynthesis", "start": 1615, "end": 1639, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:151", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "Planck", "start": 1659, "end": 1665, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Moon/4749", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "seven", "start": 1721, "end": 1726, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01aktk249", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "oscillations", "start": 1982, "end": 1994, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/ATMOSPHERE/ATMOSPHERIC_PRESSURE/OSCILLATIONS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "adiabatic", "start": 1999, "end": 2008, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:stateThermodynamic/Adiabatic", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "early universe", "start": 2035, "end": 2049, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:435", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}]}

Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at λ&gt;~40 μm. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T~40-55 K (warm dust) and T~20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ɛ=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to ~150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 μm and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 μm is ~1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 μm is less than 15% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of ~2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z&gt;~1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at λ>~40 μm.

Calibration errors are less than 0.5%, and the low systematic error level is well specified. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is separated from the foregrounds using multifrequency data. The sky maps are consistent with the 7° FWHM Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) maps. We report more precise, but consistent, dipole and quadrupole values. The CMB anisotropy obeys Gaussian statistics with -58<fNL<134 (95% confidence level [CL]). The 2<=l<=900 anisotropy power spectrum is cosmic-variance-limited for l<354, with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1 per mode to l=658. The temperature-polarization cross-power spectrum reveals both acoustic features and a large-angle correlation from reionization. The optical depth of reionization is τ=0.17+/-0.04, which implies a reionization epoch of tr=180+220-80 Myr (95% CL) after the big bang at a redshift of zr=20+10-9 (95% CL) for a range of ionization scenarios. This early reionization is incompatible with the presence of a significant warm dark matter density. A best-fit cosmological model to the CMB and other measures of large-scale structure works remarkably well with only a few parameters. The age of the best-fit universe is t0=13.7+/-0.2 Gyr. Decoupling was tdec=379+8-7 kyr after the big bang at a redshift of zdec=1089+/-1. The thickness of the decoupling surface was Δzdec=195+/-2. The matter density of the universe is Ωmh2=0.135+0.008-0.009, the baryon density is Ωbh2=0.0224+/-0.0009, and the total mass-energy of the universe is Ωtot=1.02+/-0.02. It appears that there may be progressively less fluctuation power on smaller scales, from WMAP to fine-scale CMB measurements to galaxies and finally to the Lyα forest. This may be accounted for with a running spectral index of scalar fluctuations, fitted as ns=0.93+/-0.03 at wavenumber k0=0.05 Mpc-1 (leff~700), with a slope of dns/dlnk=-0.031+0.016-0.018 in the best-fit model. (For WMAP data alone, ns=0.99+/-0.04.) This flat universe model is composed of 4.4% baryons, 22% dark matter, and 73% dark energy. The dark energy equation of state is limited to w<-0.78 (95% CL). Inflation theory is supported with ns~1, Ωtot~1, Gaussian random phases of the CMB anisotropy, and superhorizon fluctuations implied by the temperature-polarization anticorrelations at decoupling.

{"bibcode": "2003RvMP...75..559P", "title": "The cosmological constant and dark energy", "abstract": "Physics welcomes the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational effect approximates that of Einstein’s cosmological constant, Λ; today the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence. Physics also suggests that dark energy could be dynamical, allowing for the arguably appealing picture of an evolving dark-energy density approaching its natural value, zero, and small now because the expanding universe is old. This would alleviate the classical problem of the curious energy scale of a millielectron volt associated with a constant Λ. Dark energy may have been detected by recent cosmological tests. These tests make a good scientific case for the context, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lemaître model, in which the gravitational inverse-square law is applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one-quarter of the critical Einstein de Sitter value.

Physics also suggests that dark energy could be dynamical, allowing for the arguably appealing picture of an evolving dark-energy density approaching its natural value, zero, and small now because the expanding universe is old. This would alleviate the classical problem of the curious energy scale of a millielectron volt associated with a constant Λ. Dark energy may have been detected by recent cosmological tests. These tests make a good scientific case for the context, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lemaître model, in which the gravitational inverse-square law is applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one-quarter of the critical Einstein de Sitter value.

Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Ωm=0.273+/-0.025+0.123(1+w0)+0.137ΩK. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is ΩK=-0.010+/-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.", "database": ["astronomy"], "keywords": ["Cosmology: Cosmic Microwave Background", "Cosmology: Cosmological Parameters", "Cosmology: Observations", "Cosmology: Distance Scale", "Galaxies: Elliptical and Lenticular", "cD", "Cosmology: Large-Scale Structure of Universe", "Astrophysics"], "year": "2005", "doctype": "article", "citation_count": 4571, "domain_category": "astronomy", "spans": [{"surface": "large", "start": 15, "end": 20, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:028nd8457", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "galaxies", "start": 108, "end": 116, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:573", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "best", "start": 237, "end": 241, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/CLIMATE_INDICATORS/ATMOSPHERIC/OCEAN_INDICATORS/TELECONNECTIONS/BIVARIATE_ENSO_TIMESERIES_INDEX/BEST", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "study of", "start": 261, "end": 269, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaHuman/studyOf", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "large", "start": 270, "end": 275, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:028nd8457", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "find", "start": 296, "end": 300, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05tcsqz68", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "shape", "start": 420, "end": 425, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01k02wt67", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "recombination", "start": 461, "end": 474, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:2072", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "oscillations", "start": 490, "end": 502, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/ATMOSPHERE/ATMOSPHERIC_PRESSURE/OSCILLATIONS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "redshift", "start": 514, "end": 522, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1379", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "clustering", "start": 523, "end": 533, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1908", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "detection", "start": 550, "end": 559, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1911", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "gravitational instability", "start": 607, "end": 632, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:668", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "firm", "start": 679, "end": 683, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:051xfvw62", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "ratio", "start": 804, "end": 809, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:00j5mtz35", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "shape", "start": 943, "end": 948, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01k02wt67", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "matter density", "start": 993, "end": 1007, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1014", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "find", "start": 1023, "end": 1027, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05tcsqz68", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "cosmic microwave background", "start": 1058, "end": 1085, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:322", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "find", "start": 1176, "end": 1180, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05tcsqz68", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "find", "start": 1256, "end": 1260, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05tcsqz68", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "dark energy", "start": 1316, "end": 1327, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:351", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "cosmological constant", "start": 1333, "end": 1354, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:334", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "dark energy", "start": 1458, "end": 1469, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:351", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "based on", "start": 1471, "end": 1479, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:relaMath/basedOn", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "microwave", "start": 1535, "end": 1544, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/SPECTRAL/ENGINEERING/MICROWAVE", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}]}

{"bibcode": "1996PhR...267..195J", "title": "Supersymmetric dark matter", "abstract": "There is almost universal agreement among astronomers that most of the mass in the Universe and most of the mass in the Galactic halo is dark. Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, as yet undiscovered, weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). There is now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to detect WIMPs in the halo. The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter.

Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, as yet undiscovered, weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). There is now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to detect WIMPs in the halo. The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter.

The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass [Formula: see text] and the velocity dispersion σ of the bulge component of the host galaxy.

Black carbon is a type of carbonaceous material with a unique combination of physical properties. This assessment provides an evaluation of black-carbon climate forcing that is comprehensive in its inclusion of all known and relevant processes and that is quantitative in providing best estimates and uncertainties of the main forcing terms: direct solar absorption; influence on liquid, mixed phase, and ice clouds; and deposition on snow and ice. These effects are calculated with climate models, but when possible, they are evaluated with both microphysical measurements and field observations. Predominant sources are combustion related, namely, fossil fuels for transportation, solid fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open burning of biomass. Total global emissions of black carbon using bottom-up inventory methods are 7500 Gg yr<SUP>-1</SUP> in the year 2000 with an uncertainty range of 2000 to 29000. However, global atmospheric absorption attributable to black carbon is too low in many models and should be increased by a factor of almost 3. After this scaling, the best estimate for the industrial-era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is +0.71 W m<SUP>-2</SUP> with 90% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W m<SUP>-2</SUP>. Total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W m<SUP>-2</SUP>. Direct radiative forcing alone does not capture important rapid adjustment mechanisms. A framework is described and used for quantifying climate forcings, including rapid adjustments. The best estimate of industrial-era climate forcing of black carbon through all forcing mechanisms, including clouds and cryosphere forcing, is +1.1 W m<SUP>-2</SUP> with 90% uncertainty bounds of +0.17 to +2.1 W m<SUP>-2</SUP>. Thus, there is a very high probability that black carbon emissions, independent of co-emitted species, have a positive forcing and warm the climate. We estimate that black carbon, with a total climate forcing of +1.1 W m<SUP>-2</SUP>, is the second most important human emission in terms of its climate forcing in the present-day atmosphere; only carbon dioxide is estimated to have a greater forcing. Sources that emit black carbon also emit other short-lived species that may either cool or warm climate. Climate forcings from co-emitted species are estimated and used in the framework described herein. When the principal effects of short-lived co-emissions, including cooling agents such as sulfur dioxide, are included in net forcing, energy-related sources (fossil fuel and biofuel) have an industrial-era climate forcing of +0.22 (-0.50 to +1.08) W m<SUP>-2</SUP> during the first year after emission. For a few of these sources, such as diesel engines and possibly residential biofuels, warming is strong enough that eliminating all short-lived emissions from these sources would reduce net climate forcing (i.e., produce cooling). When open burning emissions, which emit high levels of organic matter, are included in the total, the best estimate of net industrial-era climate forcing by all short-lived species from black-carbon-rich sources becomes slightly negative (-0.06 W m<SUP>-2</SUP> with 90% uncertainty bounds of -1.45 to +1.29 W m<SUP>-2</SUP>). The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black-carbon-rich sources are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both black carbon and co-emitted organic carbon. In prioritizing potential black-carbon mitigation actions, non-science factors, such as technical feasibility, costs, policy design, and implementation feasibility play important roles. The major sources of black carbon are presently in different stages with regard to the feasibility for near-term mitigation.

{"bibcode": "1995GeCoA..59.1217W", "title": "The composition of the continental crust", "abstract": "A new calculation of the crustal composition is based on the proportions of upper crust (UC) to felsic lower crust (FLC) to mafic lower crust (MLC) of about 1:0.6:0.4. These proportions are derived from a 3000 km long refraction seismic profile through western Europe (EGT) comprising 60% old shield and 40% younger fold belt area with about 40 km average Moho depth. A granodioritic bulk composition of the UC in major elements and thirty-two minor and trace elements was calculated from the Canadian Shield data (Shaw et al., 1967, 1976). The computed abundance of thirty-three additional trace elements in the UC is based on the following proportions of major rock units derived from mapping: 14% sedimentary rocks, 25% granites, 20% granodiorites, 5% tonalites, 6% gabbros, and 30% gneisses and mica schists. The composition of FLC and MLC in major and thirty-six minor and trace elements is calculated from data on felsic granulite terrains and mafic xenoliths, respectively, compiled by Rudnick and Presper (1990). More than thirty additional trace element abundances in FLC and MLC were computed or estimated from literature data. The bulk continental crust has a tonalitic and not a dioritic composition with distinctly higher concentrations of incompatible elements including the heat producing isotopes in our calculation. A dioritic bulk crust was suggested by Taylor and McLennan (1985). The amount of tonalite in the crust requires partial melting of mafic rocks with about 100 km thickness (compared with about 7 km in the present MLC) and water supply from dehydrated slabs and mafic intrusions. At the relatively low temperatures of old crustal segments MLC was partly converted into eclogite which could be recycled into the upper mantle under favourable tectonic conditions. The chemical fractionation of UC against FLC + MLC was caused by granitoidal partial melts and by mantle degassing which has controlled weathering and accumulation of volatile compounds close to the Earth's surface.", "abstract_clean": "A new calculation of the crustal composition is based on the proportions of upper crust (UC) to felsic lower crust (FLC) to mafic lower crust (MLC) of about 1:0.6:0.4. These proportions are derived from a 3000 km long refraction seismic profile through western Europe (EGT) comprising 60% old shield and 40% younger fold belt area with about 40 km average Moho depth. A granodioritic bulk composition of the UC in major elements and thirty-two minor and trace elements was calculated from the Canadian Shield data (Shaw et al., 1967, 1976). The computed abundance of thirty-three additional trace elements in the UC is based on the following proportions of major rock units derived from mapping: 14% sedimentary rocks, 25% granites, 20% granodiorites, 5% tonalites, 6% gabbros, and 30% gneisses and mica schists.

{"bibcode": "2005EcoM...75....3H", "title": "Effects of Biodiversity on Ecosystem Functioning: a Consensus of Current Knowledge", "abstract": "Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.", "abstract_clean": "Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global.

Due to mathematical feedback between the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations and, similarly, between the barotropic momentum and continuity equations, it is advantageous to treat both modes so that, after a time step for the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and vice versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step simultaneously. This leads to a new family of time-stepping algorithms that combine forward-backward feedback with the best known synchronous algorithms, allowing an increased time step due to the enhanced internal stability without sacrificing its accuracy. Based on these algorithms we design a split-explicit hydrodynamic kernel for a realistic oceanic model, which addresses multiple numerical issues associated with mode splitting. This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of the barotropic mode via a specially designed filter function to guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers and yields more accurate (up to second-order), resolved barotropic processes, while preventing aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals into the slow baroclinic motions.

Estimates of the above-canopy fluxes are needed for quantitative earth system studies and assessments of past, present and future air quality and climate.

{"bibcode": "2018NatSD...580214B", "title": "Present and future Köppen-Geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution", "abstract": "We present new global maps of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification at an unprecedented 1-km resolution for the present-day (1980-2016) and for projected future conditions (2071-2100) under climate change. The present-day map is derived from an ensemble of four high-resolution, topographically-corrected climatic maps. The future map is derived from an ensemble of 32 climate model projections (scenario RCP8.5), by superimposing the projected climate change anomaly on the baseline high-resolution climatic maps. For both time periods we calculate confidence levels from the ensemble spread, providing valuable indications of the reliability of the classifications.

Few survive the hazards of chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become naturalized. In turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. There are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. Ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. Whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) Animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) Plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species.

In particular, we analyse the effect of the extrapolation of night-time values of ecosystem respiration into the daytime; this is usually done with a temperature response function that is derived from long-term data sets. For this analysis, we used 16 one-year-long data sets of carbon dioxide exchange measurements from European and US-American eddy covariance networks. These sites span from the boreal to Mediterranean climates, and include deciduous and evergreen forest, scrubland and crop ecosystems. We show that the temperature sensitivity of R<SUB>eco</SUB>, derived from long-term (annual) data sets, does not reflect the short-term temperature sensitivity that is effective when extrapolating from night- to daytime. Specifically, in summer active ecosystems the long-term temperature sensitivity exceeds the short-term sensitivity. Thus, in those ecosystems, the application of a long-term temperature sensitivity to the extrapolation of respiration from night to day leads to a systematic overestimation of ecosystem respiration from half-hourly to annual time-scales, which can reach &gt;25% for an annual budget and which consequently affects estimates of GEP.

Models of continental growth, continental composition, convergent margin magmatism and mantle heterogeneity all require a better understanding of the mass and chemical fluxes associated with subducting sediments. We have evaluated subducting sediments on a global basis in order to better define their chemical systematics and to determine both regional and global average compositions. We then use these compositions to assess the importance of sediments to arc volcanism and crust-mantle recycling, and to re-evaluate the chemical composition of the continental crust. The large variations in the chemical composition of marine sediments are for the most part linked to the main lithological constituents. The alkali elements (K, Rb and Cs) and high field strength elements (Ti, Nb, Hf, Zr) are closely linked to the detrital phase in marine sediments; Th is largely detrital but may be enriched in the hydrogenous Fe-Mn component of sediments; REE patterns are largely continental, but abundances are closely linked to fish debris phosphate; U is mostly detrital, but also dependent on the supply and burial rate of organic matter; Ba is linked to both biogenic barite and hydrothermal components; Sr is linked to carbonate phases. Thus, the important geochemical tracers follow the lithology of the sediments. Sediment lithologies are controlled in turn by a small number of factors: proximity of detrital sources (volcanic and continental); biological productivity and preservation of carbonate and opal; and sedimentation rate. Because of the link with lithology and the wealth of lithological data routinely collected for ODP and DSDP drill cores, bulk geochemical averages can be calculated to better than 30% for most elements from fewer than ten chemical analyses for a typical drill core (100-1000 m). Combining the geochemical systematics with convergence rate and other parameters permits calculation of regional compositional fluxes for subducting sediment. These regional fluxes can be compared to the compositions of arc volcanics to asses the importance of sediment subduction to arc volcanism. For the 70% of the trenches worldwide where estimates can be made, the regional fluxes also provide the basis for a global subducting sediment (GLOSS) composition and flux. GLOSS is dominated by terrigenous material (76 wt% terrigenous, 7 wt% calcium carbonate, 10 wt% opal, 7 wt% mineral-bound H <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUP>+</SUP>), and therefore similar to upper continental crust (UCC) in composition. Exceptions include enrichment in Ba, Mn and the middle and heavy REE, and depletions in detrital elements diluted by biogenic material (alkalis, Th, Zr, Hf). Sr and Pb are identical in GLOSS and UCC as a result of a balance between dilution and enrichment by marine phases. GLOSS and the systematics of marine sediments provide an independent approach to the composition of the upper continental crust for detrital elements. Significant discrepancies of up to a factor of two exist between the marine sediment data and current upper crustal estimates for Cs, Nb, Ta and Ti. Suggested revisions to UCC include Cs (7.3 ppm), Nb (13.7 ppm), Ta (0.96 ppm) and TiO <SUB>2</SUB> (0.76 wt%). These revisions affect recent bulk continental crust estimates for La/Nb and U/Nb, and lead to an even greater contrast between the continents and mantle for these important trace element ratios. GLOSS and the regional sediment data also provide new insights into the mantle sources of oceanic basalts. The classical geochemical distinction between `pelagic' and `terrigenous' sediment sources is not valid and needs to be replaced by a more comprehensive understanding of the compositional variations in complete sedimentary columns. In addition, isotopic arguments based on surface sediments alone can lead to erroneous conclusions. Specifically, the Nd/Hf ratio of GLOSS relaxes considerably the severe constraints on the amount of sediment recycling into the mantle based on earlier estimates from surface sediment compositions.", "abstract_clean": "Subducted sediments play an important role in arc magmatism and crust-mantle recycling.

Seafloor spreading rates and fault azimuths are used to determine the motions of 19 plates bordered by mid-ocean ridges, including all the major plates. Six smaller plates with little or no connection to the mid-ocean ridges are linked to MORVEL with GPS station velocities and azimuthal data. By design, almost no kinematic information is exchanged between the geologically determined and geodetically constrained subsets of the global circuit-MORVEL thus averages motion over geological intervals for all the major plates. Plate geometry changes relative to NUVEL-1A include the incorporation of Nubia, Lwandle and Somalia plates for the former Africa plate, Capricorn, Australia and Macquarie plates for the former Australia plate, and Sur and South America plates for the former South America plate. MORVEL also includes Amur, Philippine Sea, Sundaland and Yangtze plates, making it more useful than NUVEL-1A for studies of deformation in Asia and the western Pacific. Seafloor spreading rates are estimated over the past 0.78 Myr for intermediate and fast spreading centres and since 3.16 Ma for slow and ultraslow spreading centres. Rates are adjusted downward by 0.6-2.6mmyr<SUP>-1</SUP> to compensate for the several kilometre width of magnetic reversal zones. Nearly all the NUVEL-1A angular velocities differ significantly from the MORVEL angular velocities. The many new data, revised plate geometries, and correction for outward displacement thus significantly modify our knowledge of geologically current plate motions. MORVEL indicates significantly slower 0.78-Myr-average motion across the Nazca-Antarctic and Nazca-Pacific boundaries than does NUVEL-1A, consistent with a progressive slowdown in the eastward component of Nazca plate motion since 3.16 Ma. It also indicates that motions across the Caribbean-North America and Caribbean-South America plate boundaries are twice as fast as given by NUVEL-1A. Summed, least-squares differences between angular velocities estimated from GPS and those for MORVEL, NUVEL-1 and NUVEL-1A are, respectively, 260 per cent larger for NUVEL-1 and 50 per cent larger for NUVEL-1A than for MORVEL, suggesting that MORVEL more accurately describes historically current plate motions. Significant differences between geological and GPS estimates of Nazca plate motion and Arabia-Eurasia and India-Eurasia motion are reduced but not eliminated when using MORVEL instead of NUVEL-1A, possibly indicating that changes have occurred in those plate motions since 3.16 Ma.

{"bibcode": "1993Icar..101..108K", "title": "Habitable Zones around Main Sequence Stars", "abstract": "A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<SUB>2</SUB>O/N<SUB>2</SUB> atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO<SUB>2</SUB> clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N<SUB>2</SUB> partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. <P />Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.", "abstract_clean": "A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in.

The observational results of the study are: (1) Large-amplitude, nonsinusoidal Alfvén waves propagating outward from the sun with a broad wavelength range from 10<SUP>3</SUP> to 5×10<SUP>6</SUP> km dominate the microscale structure at least 50% of the time; the waves frequently have energy densities comparable both to the unperturbed magnetic field energy density and to the thermal energy density. (2) The purest examples of these outwardly propagating Alfvén waves occur in high-velocity solar wind streams and on their trailing edges (where the velocity decreases slowly with time). In low-velocity regions Alfvén waves are also outwardly propagating but usually have smaller amplitudes than in the fast streams and tend to be less pure in the sense that they are more strongly intermixed with structures of a non-Alfvénic and possibly static nature. (3) The largest amplitude Alfvénic fluctuations are found in the compression regions at the leading edges of high-velocity streams where the velocity increases rapidly with time; these regions may contain significant amounts of inwardly propagating or non-Alfvénic wave modes.

These criteria are equivalent to selecting all dwarf and subdwarf stars within 25 pc with V-band flux between 0.1 and 10 times that of the Sun, giving us a physical basis for the term \"solar-type.\" New observational aspects of this work include surveys for (1) very close companions with long-baseline interferometry at the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array, (2) close companions with speckle interferometry, and (3) wide proper-motion companions identified by blinking multi-epoch archival images. In addition, we include the results from extensive radial-velocity monitoring programs and evaluate companion information from various catalogs covering many different techniques. The results presented here include four new common proper-motion companions discovered by blinking archival images. Additionally, the spectroscopic data searched reveal five new stellar companions. Our synthesis of results from many methods and sources results in a thorough evaluation of stellar and brown dwarf companions to nearby Sun-like stars. The overall observed fractions of single, double, triple, and higher-order systems are 56% ± 2%, 33% ± 2%, 8% ± 1%, and 3% ± 1%, respectively, counting all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions. If all candidate, i.e., unconfirmed, companions identified are found to be real, the percentages would change to 54% ± 2%, 34% ± 2%, 9% ± 2%, and 3% ± 1%, respectively. Our completeness analysis indicates that only a few undiscovered companions remain in this well-studied sample, implying that the majority (54% ± 2%) of solar-type stars are single, in contrast to the results of prior multiplicity studies. Our sample is large enough to enable a check of the multiplicity dependence on various physical parameters by analyzing appropriate subsamples. Bluer, more massive stars are seen as more likely to have companions than redder, less massive ones, consistent with the trend seen over the entire spectral range. Systems with larger interaction cross sections, i.e., those with more than two components or long orbital periods, are preferentially younger, suggesting that companions may be stripped over time by dynamical interactions. We confirm the planet-metallicity correlation (i.e., higher metallicity stars are more likely to host planets), but are unable to check it for brown dwarfs due to the paucity of such companions, implying that the brown dwarf desert extends over all separation regimes. We find no correlation between stellar companions and metallicity for B - V &lt; 0.625, but among the redder subset, metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] &lt;-0.3) are more likely to have companions with a 2.4σ significance. The orbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log normal with a peak and median of about 300 years. The period-eccentricity relation shows the expected circularization for periods below 12 days, caused by tidal forces over the age of the Galaxy, followed by a roughly flat distribution. The mass-ratio distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs, which occur more frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet hosts among single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that planets are as likely to form around single stars as they are around components of binary or multiple systems with sufficiently wide separations.

After a series of highly eccentric Earth orbits with apogees beyond the moon, each spacecraft used close flybys of the moon to escape into orbits about the Sun near 1 AU. Once in heliospheric orbit, one spacecraft trails Earth while the other leads. As viewed from the Sun, the two spacecraft separate at approximately 44 to 45 degrees per year. The purposes of the STEREO Mission are to understand the causes and mechanisms of coronal mass ejection (CME) initiation and to follow the propagation of CMEs through the inner heliosphere to Earth. Researchers will use STEREO measurements to study the mechanisms and sites of energetic particle acceleration and to develop three-dimensional (3-D) time-dependent models of the magnetic topology, temperature, density and velocity of the solar wind between the Sun and Earth. To accomplish these goals, each STEREO spacecraft is equipped with an almost identical set of optical, radio and in situ particles and fields instruments provided by U.S. and European investigators. The SECCHI suite of instruments includes two white light coronagraphs, an extreme ultraviolet imager and two heliospheric white light imagers which track CMEs out to 1 AU. The IMPACT suite of instruments measures in situ solar wind electrons, energetic electrons, protons and heavier ions. IMPACT also includes a magnetometer to measure the in situ magnetic field strength and direction. The PLASTIC instrument measures the composition of heavy ions in the ambient plasma as well as protons and alpha particles. The S/WAVES instrument uses radio waves to track the location of CME-driven shocks and the 3-D topology of open field lines along which flow particles produced by solar flares.

NOAA forecasters at the Space Environment Center and others will use these data in their space weather forecasting and their resultant products will be widely used throughout the world.

Imaging detections are challenging because of the combined effect of small angular separation and large luminosity contrast between a planet and its host star. High-contrast observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes have revealed three planets orbiting the star HR 8799, with projected separations of 24, 38, and 68 astronomical units.

We have identified 95 detached binary systems containing 190 stars (94 eclipsing systems, and α Centauri) that satisfy our criterion that the mass and radius of both stars be known within errors of ±3% accuracy or better. All of them are non-interacting systems, and so the stars should have evolved as if they were single. This sample more than doubles that of the earlier similar review by Andersen (Astron Astrophys Rev 3:91-126, 1991), extends the mass range at both ends and, for the first time, includes an extragalactic binary. In every case, we have examined the original data and recomputed the stellar parameters with a consistent set of assumptions and physical constants. To these we add interstellar reddening, effective temperature, metal abundance, rotational velocity and apsidal motion determinations when available, and we compute a number of other physical parameters, notably luminosity and distance. These accurate physical parameters reveal the effects of stellar evolution with unprecedented clarity, and we discuss the use of the data in observational tests of stellar evolution models in some detail. Earlier findings of significant structural differences between moderately fast-rotating, mildly active stars and single stars, ascribed to the presence of strong magnetic and spot activity, are confirmed beyond doubt. We also show how the best data can be used to test prescriptions for the subtle interplay between convection, diffusion, and other non-classical effects in stellar models. The amount and quality of the data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the systems in considerable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational synchronisation and orbital circularisation in greater detail than possible before. We show that the formulae for pseudo-synchronisation of stars in eccentric orbits predict the observed rotations quite well, except for very young and/or widely separated stars. Deviations do occur, however, especially for stars with convective envelopes. The superior data set finally demonstrates that apsidal motion rates as predicted from General Relativity plus tidal theory are in good agreement with the best observational data. No reliable binary data exist, which challenge General Relativity to any significant extent. The new data also enable us to derive empirical calibrations of M and R for single (post-) main-sequence stars above {0.6 M_{odot}}. Simple, polynomial functions of T <SUB>eff</SUB>, log g and [Fe/H] yield M and R within errors of 6 and 3%, respectively. Excellent agreement is found with independent determinations for host stars of transiting extrasolar planets, and good agreement with determinations of M and R from stellar models as constrained by trigonometric parallaxes and spectroscopic values of T <SUB>eff</SUB> and [Fe/H].

Examples include patterns in hydrodynamic systems such as thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures, Taylor-Couette flow, parametric-wave instabilities, as well as patterns in solidification fronts, nonlinear optics, oscillatory chemical reactions and excitable biological media. The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times.

Far from the instability threshold a different universal description known as the \"phase equation\" may be derived, but it is restricted to slow distortions of an ideal pattern. For many systems appropriate starting equations are either not known or too complicated to analyze conveniently. It is thus useful to introduce phenomenological order-parameter models, which lead to the correct amplitude equations near threshold, and which may be solved analytically or numerically in the nonlinear regime away from the instability. The above theoretical methods are useful in analyzing \"real pattern effects\" such as the influence of external boundaries, or the formation and dynamics of defects in ideal structures.

It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the 'folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| &gt;0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction.

The meteoritic and solar abundances of a few elements (e.g., noble gases, beryllium, boron, phosphorous, sulfur) are discussed in detail.

Literature is reviewed on the adsorption and reaction of a wide variety of inorganic molecules (H 2, O 2, H 2O, CO, CO 2, N 2, NH 3, NO x, sulfur- and halogen-containing molecules, rare gases) as well as organic molecules (carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, alkynes, pyridine and its derivates, silanes, methyl halides). The application of TiO 2-based systems in photo-active devices is discussed, and the results on UHV-based photocatalytic studies are summarized. The review ends with a brief conclusion and outlook of TiO 2-based surface science for the future.", "database": ["physics"], "keywords": [], "year": "2003", "doctype": "article", "citation_count": 3659, "domain_category": "multidisciplinary", "spans": [{"surface": "Titanium", "start": 0, "end": 8, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/TERRESTRIAL_HYDROSPHERE/WATER_QUALITY/WATER_CHEMISTRY/CONTAMINANTS/TITANIUM", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "most", "start": 24, "end": 28, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01d0zv889", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "rutile", "start": 130, "end": 136, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:matrMineral/Rutile", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "anatase", "start": 168, "end": 175, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:matrMineral/Anatase", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "wide", "start": 238, "end": 242, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05qgc7m36", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "rutile", "start": 464, "end": 470, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:matrMineral/Rutile", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "rutile", "start": 505, "end": 511, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:matrMineral/Rutile", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "shear", "start": 767, "end": 772, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:04kj21e96", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "CSPs", "start": 780, "end": 784, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05s0j2r87", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "methods", "start": 993, "end": 1000, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "uat:1043", "source_vocabulary": "uat"}, {"surface": "models", "start": 1263, "end": 1269, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE_SERVICES/MODELS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "Very", "start": 1324, "end": 1328, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "planetary:Mars/6364", "source_vocabulary": "planetary"}, {"surface": "anatase", "start": 1347, "end": 1354, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:matrMineral/Anatase", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "vibrational", "start": 1558, "end": 1569, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:stateChemical/Vibrational", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "metals", "start": 1783, "end": 1789, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/SOLID_EARTH/ROCKS/MINERALS/CRYSTALS/METALS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "oxidation/reduction", "start": 2052, "end": 2071, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/SOLID_EARTH/GEOCHEMISTRY/GEOCHEMICAL_PROCESSES/OXIDATION/REDUCTION", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "trends", "start": 2098, "end": 2104, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:02qx6zf82", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "across", "start": 2105, "end": 2111, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:00tfmma03", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "reactivity", "start": 2141, "end": 2151, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:propChemical/Reactivity", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "oxygen", "start": 2183, "end": 2189, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/OCEANS/OCEAN_CHEMISTRY/OXYGEN", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "most", "start": 2200, "end": 2204, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01d0zv889", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "metals", "start": 2340, "end": 2346, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/SOLID_EARTH/ROCKS/MINERALS/CRYSTALS/METALS", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "interaction", "start": 2376, "end": 2387, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:01pdc9z31", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "SMSI", "start": 2390, "end": 2394, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05dtq3097", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "adsorption", "start": 2447, "end": 2457, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:procChemical/Adsorption", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "wide", "start": 2476, "end": 2480, "type": "entity", "canonical_id": "ror:05qgc7m36", "source_vocabulary": "ror"}, {"surface": "sulfur", "start": 2556, "end": 2562, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/AGRICULTURE/SOILS/SULFUR", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}, {"surface": "halogen", "start": 2568, "end": 2575, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "sweet:matrElement/Halogen", "source_vocabulary": "sweet"}, {"surface": "gases", "start": 2603, "end": 2608, "type": "topic", "canonical_id": "gcmd:EARTH_SCIENCE/TERRESTRIAL_HYDROSPHERE/WATER_QUALITY/WATER_CHEMISTRY/GASES", "source_vocabulary": "gcmd"}]}
