# NLS Fine-tune SciX - Hybrid NER Pipeline

## Codebase Patterns

- **Operator Gating Rule**: Only set IntentSpec.operator when EXPLICIT patterns match ("papers citing X", "references of X"), NOT for generic words like "citing" or "references" used as topics
- **FIELD_ENUMS Validation**: All doctype/property/database/bibgroup/esources/data values MUST be validated against FIELD_ENUMS before assembly
- **Quote Multi-word Phrases**: Single-word values can be bare, multi-word phrases MUST be quoted in ADS syntax
- **No LLM for Operators**: Operators become enum decisions, not generated text. LLM only for paper reference resolution

## Project Context

This Ralph cycle implements a **hybrid NER + fine-tuned model pipeline** to replace end-to-end generation that caused malformed operators like `citations(abs:referencesabs:...)`.

**Previous approach (archived)**: End-to-end fine-tuned Qwen3-1.7B model that learned to conflate natural language words with ADS operator syntax.

**New approach**: 
1. NER extracts structured IntentSpec
2. Few-shot retrieval from gold_examples.json for pattern guidance
3. Deterministic template assembly with FIELD_ENUMS validation
4. Fine-tuned model ONLY as fallback for ambiguous paper references

## Key Learnings from Previous Iteration

- Training data quality is the root cause of malformed operators
- 7K training examples with only 4.4% operator coverage conflated NL with ADS syntax
- Post-processing filters (constrain.py) are band-aids, not solutions
- Need deterministic query building, not end-to-end generation

## 2026-01-21 - US-001: Define IntentSpec dataclass and pipeline skeleton
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019be380-a26d-74a8-a7bf-01162d7c7510

### What was implemented
- Created `intent_spec.py` with typed IntentSpec dataclass:
  - All required fields: free_text_terms, authors, affiliations, objects, year_from, year_to
  - Enum constraint fields: doctype, property, database, bibgroup, esources, data (as set[str])
  - Operator fields: operator (validated against OPERATORS frozenset), operator_target
  - Metadata: raw_user_text, confidence dict
  - Methods: has_constraints(), has_content(), to_dict(), to_json(), from_dict(), from_json()
  - Operator validation in __post_init__

- Created `pipeline.py` with skeleton:
  - GoldExample dataclass for retrieval results
  - DebugInfo dataclass with timing fields
  - PipelineResult with intent, retrieved_examples, final_query, debug_info, success, error
  - process_query() function with placeholder implementations for each stage
  - is_ads_query() helper for detecting pre-formed ADS syntax

- Added 36 unit tests in tests/test_intent_spec.py:
  - IntentSpec instantiation, serialization, deserialization, roundtrip
  - Operator validation (valid/invalid)
  - has_constraints() and has_content() helpers
  - Pipeline returns stable keys
  - is_ads_query() detection

### Files changed
- packages/finetune/src/finetune/domains/scix/intent_spec.py (new)
- packages/finetune/src/finetune/domains/scix/pipeline.py (new)
- tests/test_intent_spec.py (new)
- prd.json (updated US-001 passes: true)

### Learnings for future iterations
- Use `X | None` instead of `Optional[X]` for type annotations (ruff UP045)
- Import order must be alphabetical within stdlib/third-party groups (ruff I001)
- Sets must be converted to sorted lists for deterministic JSON serialization
- OPERATORS frozenset prevents invalid operator values at construction time
- **Word Boundary Matching**: Always use `\b` regex boundaries for synonym extraction to avoid partial matches (e.g., "oa" falsely matching inside "sloan")

## 2026-01-21 - US-002: Implement rules-based NER with strict operator gating
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019be384-fa87-76de-aa3b-e57df1c17263

### What was implemented
- Created `ner.py` with `extract_intent(text: str) -> IntentSpec` function
- Implemented strict operator gating with explicit pattern matching:
  - citations: 'papers citing', 'cited by', 'who cited'
  - references: 'references of', 'bibliography of', 'papers referenced by'
  - similar: 'similar to this paper', 'papers like'
  - trending: 'trending papers', 'what's hot'
  - useful: 'most useful'
  - reviews: 'review articles on', 'reviews of'
- Added synonym maps for all enum types:
  - PROPERTY_SYNONYMS: refereed, peer reviewed, open access, oa, arxiv, preprint
  - DOCTYPE_SYNONYMS: article, thesis, conference, software, book
  - BIBGROUP_SYNONYMS: hubble→HST, webb→JWST, sloan→SDSS, ligo→LIGO
  - DATABASE_SYNONYMS: astronomy, astrophysics, physics, general
- Year extraction patterns: from/to, since, after, before, last N years, decade
- Author extraction: by <name>, first author, et al.
- ADS query passthrough detection (skip NER for pre-formed syntax)
- Integrated into pipeline.process_query()

### Files changed
- packages/finetune/src/finetune/domains/scix/ner.py (new - 777 lines)
- packages/finetune/src/finetune/domains/scix/pipeline.py (modified - use NER)
- tests/test_ner.py (new - 75 tests)
- prd.json (updated US-002 passes: true)

### Learnings for future iterations
- **Word boundary matching is critical**: Substring matching causes false positives (e.g., "oa" in "sloan" matching openaccess synonym)
- **Author regex should not be greedy**: Avoid matching stopwords like "on" as part of author names
- **Stopwords must include "of"**: Was missing from initial stopwords set
- **Test negative cases extensively**: Operator gating requires testing both positive patterns AND ensuring generic uses don't trigger operators
